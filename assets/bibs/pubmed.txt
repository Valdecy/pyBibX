AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a useful tool in complex 
      decision-making situations, and has been used in medical fields to evaluate 
      treatment options and drug selection. This study aims to provide valuable 
      insights into MCDA in healthcare through examining the research focus of existing 
      studies, major fields, major applications, most productive authors and countries, 
      and most common journals in the domain. METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was 
      conducted on the publication related to MCDA in healthcare from the Web of 
      Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database on 14 July 2021. Three bibliometric 
      software (VOSviewer, R-bibliometrix, and CiteSpace) were used to conduct the 
      analysis including years, countries, institutes, authors, journals, co-citation 
      references, and keywords. RESULTS: A total of 410 publications were identified 
      with an average yearly growth rate of 32% (1999-2021), from 196 academic journals 
      with 23,637 co-citation references by 871 institutions from 70 countries/regions. 
      The United States was the most productive country (n = 80). Universiti Pendidikan 
      Sultan Idris (n = 16), Université de Montréal (n = 13), and Syreon Research 
      Institute (n = 12) were the top productive institutions. A A Zaidan, Mireille 
      Goetghebeur and Zoltan Kalo were the biggest nodes in every cluster of authors' 
      networks. The top journals in terms of the number of articles (n = 17) and 
      citations (n = 1,673) were Value in Health and Journal of Medical Systems, 
      respectively. The extant literature has focused on four aspects, including the 
      analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making, health technology assessment, 
      and healthcare waste management. COVID-19 and fuzzy TOPSIS received careful 
      attention from MCDA applications recently. MCDA in big data, telemedicine, 
      TOPSIS, and fuzzy AHP is well-developed and an important theme, which may be the 
      trend in future research. CONCLUSION: This study uncovers a holistic picture of 
      the performance of MCDA-related literature published in healthcare. MCDA has a 
      broad application on different topics and would be helpful for practitioners, 
      researchers, and decision-makers working in healthcare to advance the wheel of 
      medical complex decision-making. It can be argued that the door is still open for 
      improving the role of MCDA in healthcare, whether in its methodology (e.g., fuzzy 
      TOPSIS) or application (e.g., telemedicine).

TI  - Development of a Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) using multicriteria decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 543-546
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-210002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) to assess 
      glucocorticoid (GC)-related morbidity and GC-sparing ability of other therapies. 
      METHODS: Nineteen experts on GC use and outcome measures from 11 subspecialties 
      participated. Ten experts were from the USA; nine from Canada, Europe or 
      Australia. Group consensus methods and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      were used. A Composite GTI and Specific List comprise the overall GTI. The 
      Composite GTI reflects toxicity likely to change during a clinical trial. The 
      Composite GTI toxicities occur commonly, vary with GC exposure, and are weighted 
      and scored. Relative weights for items in the Composite GTI were derived by group 
      consensus and MCDA. The Specific List is designed to capture GC toxicity not 
      included in the Composite GTI. The Composite GTI was evaluated by application to 
      paper cases by the investigators and an external group of 17 subspecialists. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-one toxicity items were included in the Composite GTI and 23 in 
      the Specific List. Composite GTI evaluation showed high inter-rater agreement 
      (investigators κ 0.88, external raters κ 0.90). To assess the degree to which the 
      Composite GTI corresponds to expert clinical judgement, participants ranked 15 
      cases by clinical judgement in order of highest to lowest GC toxicity. Expert 
      rankings were then compared with case ranking by the Composite GTI, yielding 
      excellent agreement (investigators weighted κ 0.87, external raters weighted κ 
      0.77). CONCLUSIONS: We describe the development and initial evaluation of a 
      comprehensive instrument for the assessment of GC toxicity.

TI  - The Application of Multicriteria Decision Analysis Methods in Health Care: A 
      Literature Review.
PG  - 262-274
LID - 10.1177/0272989X211019040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this article are 2-fold. First, we explore the 
      application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods in different areas 
      of health care, particularly the adoption of various MCDA methods across health 
      care decision making problems. Second, we report on the publication trends on the 
      application of MCDA methods in health care. METHOD: PubMed was searched for 
      literature from 1960 to 2019 in the English language. A wide range of keywords 
      was used to retrieve relevant studies. The literature search was performed in 
      September 2019. Articles were included only if they have reported an MCDA case in 
      health care. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The search yielded 8,318 abstracts, of which 
      158 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were considered for further analysis. 
      Hybrid methods are the most widely used methods in health care decision making 
      problems. When it comes to single methods, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is 
      the most widely used method followed by TOPSIS (technique for order preference by 
      similarity to ideal solution), multiattribute utility theory, goal programming, 
      EVIDEM (evidence and value: impact on decision making), evidential reasoning, 
      discrete choice experiment, and so on. Interestingly, the usage of hybrid methods 
      has been high in recent years. AHP is most widely applied in screening and 
      diagnosing and followed by treatment, medical devices, resource allocation, and 
      so on. Furthermore, treatment, screening and diagnosing, medical devices, and 
      drug development and assessment got more attention in the MCDA context. It is 
      indicated that the application of MCDA methods to health care decision making 
      problem is determined by the nature and complexity of the health care problem. 
      However, guidelines and tools exist that assist in the selection of an MCDA 
      method.

PG  - 1558-65
LID - 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61462-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper assessment of the harms caused by the misuse of drugs can 
      inform policy makers in health, policing, and social care. We aimed to apply 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) modelling to a range of drug harms in the 
      UK. METHODS: Members of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, including 
      two invited specialists, met in a 1-day interactive workshop to score 20 drugs on 
      16 criteria: nine related to the harms that a drug produces in the individual and 
      seven to the harms to others. Drugs were scored out of 100 points, and the 
      criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance. FINDINGS: MCDA 
      modelling showed that heroin, crack cocaine, and metamfetamine were the most 
      harmful drugs to individuals (part scores 34, 37, and 32, respectively), whereas 
      alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others (46, 21, and 
      17, respectively). Overall, alcohol was the most harmful drug (overall harm score 
      72), with heroin (55) and crack cocaine (54) in second and third places. 
      INTERPRETATION: These findings lend support to previous work assessing drug 
      harms, and show how the improved scoring and weighting approach of MCDA increases 
      the differentiation between the most and least harmful drugs. However, the 
      findings correlate poorly with present UK drug classification, which is not based 
      simply on considerations of harm. FUNDING: Centre for Crime and Justice Studies

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis in oncology.
PG  - 1812-26
LID - 10.1111/hex.12178 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a growing interest in the development and application 
      of alternative decision-making frameworks within health care, including 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). Even though the literature includes 
      several reviews on MCDA methods, applications of MCDA in oncology are lacking. 
      AIM: The aim of this paper is to discuss a rationale for the use of MCDA in 
      oncology. In this context, the following research question emerged: How can MCDA 
      be used to develop a clinical decision support tool in oncology? METHODS: In this 
      paper, a brief background on decision making is presented, followed by an 
      overview of MCDA methods and process. The paper discusses some applications of 
      MCDA, proposes research opportunities in the context of oncology and presents an 
      illustrative example of how MCDA can be applied to oncology. FINDINGS: Decisions 
      in oncology involve trade-offs between possible benefits and harms. MCDA can help 
      analyse trade-off preferences. A wide range of MCDA methods exist. Each method 
      has its strengths and weaknesses. Choosing the appropriate method varies 
      depending on the source and nature of information used to inform decision making. 
      The literature review identified eight studies. The analytical hierarchy process 
      (AHP) was the most often used method in the identified studies. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, MCDA appears to be a promising tool that can be used to assist clinical 
      decision making in oncology. Nonetheless, field testing is desirable before MCDA 
      becomes an established decision-making tool in this field.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used for 
      decision making in healthcare. However, its application in different 
      decision-making contexts is still unclear. This study aimed to provide a 
      comprehensive review of MCDA studies performed to inform decisions in healthcare 
      and to summarize its application in different decision contexts. METHODS: We 
      updated a systematic review conducted in 2013 by searching Embase, MEDLINE, and 
      Google Scholar for MCDA studies in healthcare, published in English between 
      August 2013 and November 2020. We also expanded the search by reviewing grey 
      literature found via Trip Medical Database and Google, published between January 
      1990 and November 2020. A comprehensive template was developed to extract 
      information about the decision context, criteria, methods, stakeholders involved, 
      and sensitivity analyses conducted. RESULTS: From the 4295 identified studies, 
      473 studies were eligible for full-text review after assessing titles and 
      abstracts. Of those, 228 studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent data 
      extraction. The use of MCDA continues to grow in healthcare literature, with most 
      of the studies (49%) informing priority-setting decisions. Safety, cost, and 
      quality of care delivery are the most frequently used criteria, although there 
      are considerable differences across decision contexts. Almost half of the MCDA 
      studies used the linear additive model whereas scales and the analytical 
      hierarchy process were the most used techniques for scoring and weighting, 
      respectively. Not all studies report on each one of the MCDA steps, consider 
      axiomatic properties, or justify the methods used. CONCLUSIONS: A guide on how to 
      conduct and report MCDA that acknowledges the particularities of the different 
      decision contexts and methods needs to be developed.

      for Overactive Bladder Symptom Complex.

AB  - CONTEXT: The nonspecific storage symptom complex overactive bladder (OAB) is an 
      important clinical condition in functional urology. Until recently, 
      pharmacological therapy comprised antimuscarinic drugs, but more recently beta 3 
      agonists have added to the available agents. Traditional reporting of efficacy 
      and safety of these agents relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies. 
      There remains no head-to-head comparison of existing agents in the contemporary 
      literature. Contemporary conclusions on comparative efficacy and safety drawn 
      from the use of these agents are based on systematic reviews of the literature 
      and associated meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used the analytical 
      model of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare contemporary 
      pharmacotherapy for OAB. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Efficacy and safety data from 
      published, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of antimuscarinic antagonists, 
      the beta 3 agonist, and the combination of an antimuscarinic and beta 3 agonist 
      were used to populate the MCDA model. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Experts assessed 
      weights of the relative importance of favourable and unfavourable effects, which 
      provided a common measure of benefits and safety that were combined in the MCDA 
      model to give an overall ranking of the OAB drugs. RESULTS: When benefits are 
      judged as more important than safety, fesoterodine 4 or 8mg used in a flexible 
      dosing pattern provides the most favourable therapeutic option, over a wide 
      sensitivity analysis relating to benefits and harms. CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis 
      using an MCDA model, in both the flexible dosing pattern of fesoterodine and the 
      solifenacin combination with mirabegron, the benefit-safety balance is better in 
      terms of benefits and/or safety than any of the other available OAB drugs. 
      Caution in interpretation of the data has to be expressed as the fesoterodine 
      data are based on a flexible dosing regimen, which adds an additional dimension 
      of personalising therapy. PATIENT SUMMARY: Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common 
      condition with a significant impact on the quality of life. Possible symptoms 
      include the following: (1) urgency-a compelling desire to urinate, which is 
      difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence-urgency leading to 
      incontinence episodes; (3) frequency-increased frequency of wanting to pass 
      urine; and (4) nocturia-increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. 
      To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more 
      recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, 
      obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the 
      benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered 
      the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also 
      potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, 
      dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six 
      drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting 
      differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between 
      benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may 
      influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison 
      of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies 
      introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only 
      if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs 
      were available.

      review.
PG  - 365-380
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2022.2019580 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been used to inform 
      health decisions in health technology assessments (HTA) processes. This is 
      particularly important to complex treatment decisions in oncology. AREAS COVERED: 
      Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science and CRD's NHS Economic 
      Evaluation Database) were searched for studies comparing health technologies in 
      oncology, involving the concept MCDA. The ISPOR MCDA Good Practices Guidelines 
      were used to assess the reporting quality. Study selection, appraisal, and data 
      extraction were performed by two reviewers. Fifteen studies were included. The 
      main decision problem was related to health technology assessment of cancer 
      treatments. Clinicians and public health experts were the most frequent 
      stakeholders. The most frequently included criteria comprised therapeutic 
      benefit, and socio-economic impact. Value measurement approach, direct rating 
      techniques, and additive model for aggregation were used in most studies. 
      Uncertainty analysis revealed the impact of posology and costs on the studies' 
      results. All studies showed some level of overlapping decision criteria. EXPERT 
      OPINION: There is considerable diversity of methods in MCDA for healthcare 
      decision-making in oncology. The evidence presented can serve as a resource when 
      considering which stakeholders, criteria, and techniques to include in future 
      MCDA studies in oncology.

TI  - Application of Multicriteria Decision Analysis to Determine the Value of 
      Prophylaxis Relative to On-Demand Treatment in Hemophilia A and Emicizumab versus 
      Replacement Therapy in the Greek Healthcare Setting.
PG  - 75-85
LID - 10.1007/s40261-021-01108-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hemophilia A (HA) is a rare disease that is 
      characterized by congenital underproduction or dysfunction of the endogenous 
      coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). The aim of the present study was to determine 
      the value of prophylaxis versus on-demand treatment strategies for moderate to 
      severe HA (MtSHA) patients and the value of emicizumab in the prophylaxis of 
      MtSHA in Greece, compared with short half-life (SHL) FVIII and extended half-life 
      (EHL) FVIII through multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). METHODS: A literature 
      review was performed to identify a set of criteria relevant to the therapeutic 
      approaches and therapies under investigation. A performance matrix was populated 
      by two literature reviews and meta-analyses. The criteria selected were 
      hierarchically classified by allocating weights on a 0-100 scale. The 
      performances of therapies were scored at the 100-point scale. The value judgments 
      utilized for weighing and scoring were sourced via a survey among independent 
      multidisciplinary system stakeholders. A linear additive value function was used 
      for the calculation of total value estimates. RESULTS: The participants ranked 
      'annual number of bleedings per patient' and 'percentage of target joint bleeds' 
      as the most important criteria, while the least important criterion was the 
      'annual treatment cost' for both assessments. Based on the weights elicited and 
      the performance in each criterion, the overall value score was higher for 
      prophylaxis treatment (58.27) compared with on-demand treatment (40.13). In the 
      other comparison, the most valued treatment was emicizumab (77.05) followed by 
      EHL FVIII (71.52) and SHL FVIII (19.88). According to the participants, the most 
      important factors for managing MtSHA patients are those related to successful 
      management of bleeding events given their contribution to improved quality of 
      life (QoL) and reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: This MCDA has shown that the 
      prophylaxis strategy was perceived as a more valuable option for managing MtSHA 
      patients when compared with the on-demand strategy. Moreover, emicizumab adds 
      higher value and improves patient QoL compared with replacement therapy for MtSHA 
      in Greece. Emicizumab addresses important unmet needs due to its improved 
      efficacy and mode of administration.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantitatively assess the benefit-risk ratio on the efficacy and 
      safety of all phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) in men with erectile 
      dysfunction. METHODS: A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface 
      under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability 
      analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of 
      Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials 
      evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other 
      PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS: Overall, 184 
      articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were 
      included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 
      25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 
      98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 
      50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good 
      profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective 
      interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse 
      events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to 
      visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal 
      congestion. CONCLUSION: Sildenafil at low doses and tadalafil should be the first 
      therapeutic options. Avanafil, lodenafil and mirodenafil use are hardly justified 
      given the lack of expressive efficacy or high rates of adverse events.

TI  - Risk Attitude in Multicriteria Decision Analysis: A Compromise Approach.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18126536 [doi]
LID - 6536
AB  - In fields on which decisions need to be taken including health, as we are seeing 
      nowadays in the COVID-19 crisis, decision-makers face multiple criteria and 
      results with a random component. In stochastic multicriteria decision-making 
      models, the risk attitude of the decision maker is a relevant factor. 
      Traditionally, the shape of a utility function is the only element that 
      represents the decision maker's risk attitude. The eduction process of 
      multi-attribute utility functions implies some operational drawbacks, and it is 
      not always easy. In this paper, we propose a new element with which the decision 
      maker's risk attitude can be implemented: the selection of the stochastic 
      efficiency concept to be used during a decision analysis. We suggest representing 
      the risk attitude as a conflict between two poles: risk neutral attitude, 
      associated with best expectations, and risk aversion attitude, associated with a 
      lower uncertainty. The Extended Goal Programming formulation has inspired the 
      parameter that is introduced in a new risk attitude formulation. This parameter 
      reflects the trade-off between the two classical poles with respect to risk 
      attitude. Thus, we have produced a new stochastic efficiency concept that we call 
      Compromise Efficiency.

TI  - International experiences in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for 
      evaluating orphan drugs: a scoping review.
PG  - 409-420
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2019.1633918 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Orphan diseases are low-prevalence conditions with chronically 
      debilitating or life-threatening consequences. Their treatments are generally 
      called orphan drugs (OD). Health-technology assessment processes have 
      traditionally considered cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), when making 
      reimbursement and pricing decisions for health-care plans. Valuing OD with 
      standard CEA raises important issues due to uncertain evidence, inability to meet 
      cost-effectiveness thresholds for reimbursement and high budget impact, among 
      others. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) allows to overcome these issues 
      and improve the technical and ethical quality of decisions regarding 
      prioritization, coverage, and reimbursement of OD. Areas covered: A scoping 
      review was conducted in order to characterize MCDA frameworks for assessing OD 
      and implementation experiences. We reviewed electronic databases (Medline, 
      Embase, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, CINAHL, EconLit, Web of Science, LILACS, Google 
      Scholar) key journals (Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases and Value in Health) and 
      organization repositories. Expert opinion: The theoretical framework for MCDA 
      considers areas related to characteristics of orphan diseases and their 
      technologies' clinical and economic impact. Participation processes are critical 
      in incorporating societal values in weighting different dimensions and 
      constructing decision rules. Local implementation pilots considering different 
      stakeholders are necessary in order to pinpoint specific barriers and 
      opportunities.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis in health care: a systematic 
      review and bibliometric analysis.
PG  - 1894-905
LID - 10.1111/hex.12287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in health care has 
      become common. However, the literature lacks systematic review trend analysis on 
      the application of MCDA in health care. AIM: To systematically identify 
      applications of MCDA to the areas of health care, and to report on publication 
      trends. METHODS: English language studies published from January 1, 1980 until 
      October 1, 2013 were included. Electronic databases searches were supplemented by 
      searching conference proceedings and relevant journals. Studies considered for 
      inclusion were those using MCDA techniques within the areas of health care, and 
      involving the participation of decision makers. A bibliometric analysis was 
      undertaken to present the publication trends. RESULTS: A total of 66 citations 
      met the inclusion criteria. An increase in publication trend occurred in the 
      years 1990, 1997, 1999, 2005, 2008, and 2012. For the remaining years, the 
      publication trend was either steady or declining. The trend shows that the number 
      of publications reached its highest peak in 2012 (n = 9). Medical Decision Making 
      was the dominant with the highest number published papers (n = 7). The majority 
      of the studies were conducted in the US (n = 29). Medical Decision Making journal 
      published the highest number of articles (n = 7). Analytic Hierarchy Process (n = 
      33) was the most used MCDA technique. Cancer was the most researched disease 
      topic (n = 12). The most covered area of application was diagnosis and treatment 
      (n = 26). CONCLUSION: The review shows that MCDA has been applied to a broad 
      range of areas in the health care, with the use of a variety of methodological 
      approaches. Further research is needed to develop practice guidelines for the 
      appropriate application and reporting of MCDA methods.

AB  - Vaccines have the potential to transform the health of all individuals and to 
      reduce the health inequality between rich and poor countries. However, to achieve 
      these goals, it is no longer sufficient to prioritize vaccine development using 
      cost-effectiveness as the sole indicator. During a symposium entitled "Mission 
      Grand Convergence-The Role of Vaccines," held in Siena, Italy, in July 2015, key 
      stakeholders agreed that the prioritization of vaccine development and deployment 
      must use multicriteria decision-making based on the following core concepts: (i) 
      mortality and severity of the disease, (ii) vaccine safety considerations, and 
      (iii) economic evaluation that captures the full benefits of vaccination.

      WHO as a global priority for investment in new drugs. In 2016, WHO was requested 
      by member states to create a priority list of other antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
      to support research and development of effective drugs. METHODS: We used a 
      multicriteria decision analysis method to prioritise antibiotic-resistant 
      bacteria; this method involved the identification of relevant criteria to assess 
      priority against which each antibiotic-resistant bacterium was rated. The final 
      priority ranking of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was established after a 
      preference-based survey was used to obtain expert weighting of criteria. 
      FINDINGS: We selected 20 bacterial species with 25 patterns of acquired 
      resistance and ten criteria to assess priority: mortality, health-care burden, 
      community burden, prevalence of resistance, 10-year trend of resistance, 
      transmissibility, preventability in the community setting, preventability in the 
      health-care setting, treatability, and pipeline. We stratified the priority list 
      into three tiers (critical, high, and medium priority), using the 33rd percentile 
      of the bacterium's total scores as the cutoff. Critical-priority bacteria 
      included carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      and carbapenem-resistant and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant 
      Enterobacteriaceae. The highest ranked Gram-positive bacteria (high priority) 
      were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and meticillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus. Of the bacteria typically responsible for 
      community-acquired infections, clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori, and 
      fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and 
      Salmonella typhi were included in the high-priority tier. INTERPRETATION: Future 
      development strategies should focus on antibiotics that are active against 
      multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and Gram-negative bacteria. The global strategy 
      should include antibiotic-resistant bacteria responsible for community-acquired 
      infections such as Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, N gonorrhoeae, and H 
      pylori. FUNDING: World Health Organization.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis in environmental decision making.
PG  - 95-108
AB  - Decision making in environmental projects can be complex and seemingly 
      intractable, principally because of the inherent trade-offs between 
      sociopolitical, environmental, ecological, and economic factors. The selection of 
      appropriate remedial and abatement strategies for contaminated sites, land use 
      planning, and regulatory processes often involves multiple additional criteria 
      such as the distribution of costs and benefits, environmental impacts for 
      different populations, safety, ecological risk, or human values. Some of these 
      criteria cannot be easily condensed into a monetary value, partly because 
      environmental concerns often involve ethical and moral principles that may not be 
      related to any economic use or value. Furthermore, even if it were possible to 
      aggregate multiple criteria rankings into a common unit, this approach would not 
      always be desirable because the ability to track conflicting stakeholder 
      preferences may be lost in the process. Consequently, selecting from among many 
      different alternatives often involves making trade-offs that fail to satisfy 1 or 
      more stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, considerable research in the area of 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has made available practical methods for 
      applying scientific decision theoretical approaches to complex multicriteria 
      problems. This paper presents a review of the available literature and provides 
      recommendations for applying MCDA techniques in environmental projects. A 
      generalized framework for decision analysis is proposed to highlight the 
      fundamental ingredients for more structured and tractable environmental decision 
      making.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis for Updating of Quality Indicators for 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Comprehensive Care Units in Spain.
PG  - 1663-1675
LID - 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Management of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is complex 
      and IBD Comprehensive Care Units [ICCUs] facilitate the delivery of quality care 
      to IBD patients. The objective of this study was to update the existing set of 
      quality indicators [QIs] for ICCUs, based on a nationwide quality certification 
      programme carried out in Spain, from a multi-stakeholder perspective and using 
      multicriteria decision analysis [MCDA] methodology. METHODS: An MCDA comprising 
      three different phases was conducted. In phase 1, a systematic literature review 
      was performed, and after validation by a scientific committee comprising 11 
      experts, a preliminary set of QIs was developed. In phase 2, a larger group of 49 
      experts determined the relevance and relative importance of each QI by 
      prioritising and weighing the preliminary set. Finally in phase 3, the scientific 
      committee reviewed the results and made a final selection via a deliberative 
      process. RESULTS: The final set comprised 67 QIs, classified as Structure [23 
      QIs], Process [35 QIs] and Outcome [9 QIs], which were ranked according to their 
      relative importance. Multidisciplinary management was the most important 
      requirement in ICCUs, followed by continuity of care, standardisation of clinical 
      care and, especially, the incorporation of patients' reported outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This updated set of QIs comprises a weighted and prioritised set of 
      items that represent the essential minimum of criteria for ensuring appropriate 
      quality of care in the management of IBD patients.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis framework to measure equitable healthcare 
      access during COVID-19.
PG  - 101331
LID - 10.1016/j.jth.2022.101331 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for 
      individuals to have easy access to healthcare facilities for treatment as well as 
      vaccinations. The surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations during 2020 also underscored 
      the fact that accessibility to nearby hospitals for testing, treatment and 
      vaccination sites is crucial for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. 
      Although necessary, quantifying healthcare access is challenging as it depends on 
      a complex interaction between underlying socioeconomic and physical factors. In 
      this case study, we deployed a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach 
      to uncover the barriers and their effect on healthcare access. Using a least cost 
      path (LCP) analysis we quantified the costs associated with healthcare access 
      from each census block group in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (LA Metro) to 
      the nearest hospital. Social vulnerability reported by the Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention (CDC), the daily number of COVID-19 cases from the Los 
      Angeles open data portal and built environment characteristics (slope of the 
      street, car ownership, population density distribution, walkability, traffic 
      collision density, and speed limit) were used to quantify overall accessibility 
      index for the entire study area. Our results showed that the census block groups 
      with a social vulnerability index above 0.75 (high vulnerability) had low 
      accessibility owing to the higher cost of access to nearby hospitals. These areas 
      were also coincident with the hotspots for COVID-19 cases and deaths which 
      highlighted the inequitable exposure of socially disadvantaged populations to 
      COVID-19 infections and how the pandemic impacts were exacerbated by the 
      synergistic effect of socioeconomic status and built environment characteristics 
      of the locations where the disadvantaged populations resided. The framework 
      proposed herein could be adapted to geo-target testing/vaccination sites and 
      improve accessibility to healthcare facilities in general and more specifically 
      among the socially vulnerable populations residing in urban areas to reduce their 
      overall health risks during future pandemic outbreaks.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for health technology assessment: the 
      Queensland Health experience.
PG  - 591-599
LID - 10.1071/AH18042 [doi]
AB  - Objectives In determining whether new health technologies should be funded, 
      health technology assessment (HTA) committees prefer explicit to implicit methods 
      of analysis in enhancing transparency and consistency of decision making. The aim 
      of this study was to develop and pilot a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      framework for the Queensland Department of Health HTA program committee, which 
      weighted decision making criteria according to their perceived importance as 
      determined by group consensus. Methods The criteria used in the MCDA framework 
      were identified by reviewing the five unweighted criteria used in the existing 
      process, consultation with committee members and literature review. Criteria were 
      clearly defined and ordinal categories of lowest to highest preferred were 
      assigned against which technology submissions would be rated. Criteria weights 
      were determined through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey of committee 
      members using validated software. Mean weighted technology scores were then used 
      to guide deliberative discussions in determining final funding decisions. Results 
      The MCDA framework created one additional criterion to the previous five. The 
      criteria and their mean weights identified through the DCE survey were clinical 
      benefit and safety (27.2%), quality of evidence (19.2%), implementation capacity 
      (16.9%), innovation (15.4%), burden of disease and clinical need (13.3%) and 
      societal and ethical values (8.0%). Criterion weights varied considerably between 
      individual committee members, with one criterion having a difference of 36.9% 
      between the highest and lowest preference weights. Following deliberative 
      discussions, all but one of 10 submissions were awarded funding. The submission 
      not supported received the third lowest score through the MCDA model. Conclusions 
      This pilot application of an MCDA framework, as a complement to committee 
      deliberation, conferred greater transparency and objectivity on HTA assessment of 
      technologies. The framework converted an implicit, unweighted review process to 
      one that is more explicit, flexible in weighting importance and pragmatic. What 
      is known about the topic? HTA programs involve complex decision-making processes 
      requiring the consideration of multiple criteria. Explicit methods of analysis 
      that use weighted criteria according to their relative importance enhance 
      transparency and consistency of decision making by HTA committees, and are 
      preferred to implicit reviews using unweighted criteria. What does this paper 
      add? This article describes the development and piloting of an MCDA framework 
      that aims to improve transparency, objectivity and consistency of funding 
      decisions of the Queensland HTA committee. Criteria were identified through a 
      review of current processes, committee discussions and a literature review, and 
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
      quality of evidence system. Criteria were weighted using a discrete choice 
      experiment involving committee members. Using weighted criteria, mean technology 
      scores were calculated and incorporated into deliberative discussions to 
      determine funding decisions. What are the implications for practitioners? The 
      MCDA framework described here converted a more implicit, unweighted process to 
      one that was more pragmatic, explicit and flexible in scoring HTA submissions. 
      This framework may be useful to other HTA programs and could be expanded to 
      resource allocation decision making in many other healthcare settings.

AB  - This study presents the application of one of the tools from the multicriteria 
      decision analysis set (MCDA), the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to 
      Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Selected green analytical chemistry metrics were used to 
      rank analytical procedures for the phthalate determination in disposable baby 
      diapers. Nine analytical procedures were assessed in order to find one that has 
      the lowest environmental impact and the best analytical figures of merit. Nine 
      different criteria, where weighting was based on the experts' evaluation, were 
      used in the procedures' assessment. With the use of TOPSIS, an easy and 
      straightforward technique, selection of the most appropriate procedure was made.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool to purchase implantable medical 
      devices in Egypt.
PG  - 289
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-02025-y [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the availability of several similar medical devices performing 
      the same function, choosing one for reimbursement is not easy, especially if 
      purchased for a large number of patients. The objective of this project was to 
      create a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool, that captures and compares 
      all implantable medical devices' attributes, to provide an objective method for 
      choosing among the available options in Egypt. METHOD: We conducted a systematic 
      review and expert interviews, to identify the relevant criteria for inclusion in 
      the tool. Subsequently, a workshop was conducted, that involved experts in 
      procuring and tendering medical devices. Experts chose the criteria, ranked them, 
      assigned weights and scoring functions for each criterion, and then created the 
      draft tool. A pilot phase followed; then, another workshop was conducted to 
      fine-tune the tool. We readjusted the tool based on experts' experience with the 
      draft tool. RESULTS: The final tool included eight criteria, arranged according 
      to their weightage: technical characteristics (29.4%), country of origin (19.5%), 
      use in reference countries (14.9%), supply reliability (11.7%), previous use in 
      tenders (9.0%), instant replacement within product variety (6.9%), 
      pharmacovigilance (4.6%), and refund or replacement (4.0%). Each medical device 
      was assessed on these eight criteria to achieve a final score, that was compared 
      to the alternative devices' scores. Price is not included in the MCDA tool, but 
      it will be added in the financial evaluation phase. CONCLUSION: Decisionmakers 
      could use the MCDA tool, to make evidence-based and objective decisions for 
      purchasing implantable devices, in the Egyptian public sector. Post price 
      evaluation, the product with the best value will be chosen for reimbursement. 
      HIGHLIGHTS: We created an MCDA tool to help decision makers choose between 
      alternative implantable medical devices in Egypt. The MCDA tool includes eight 
      criteria, where price is evaluated as a separate step. "Technical 
      characteristics" and "country of origin" criteria carried the highest weights, 
      thus representing approximately 50% of the decision.

TI  - Cloud service selection using multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 459375

LID - 459375
AB  - Cloud computing (CC) has recently been receiving tremendous attention from the IT 
      industry and academic researchers. CC leverages its unique services to cloud 
      customers in a pay-as-you-go, anytime, anywhere manner. Cloud services provide 
      dynamically scalable services through the Internet on demand. Therefore, service 
      provisioning plays a key role in CC. The cloud customer must be able to select 
      appropriate services according to his or her needs. Several approaches have been 
      proposed to solve the service selection problem, including multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA). MCDA enables the user to choose from among a number of available 
      choices. In this paper, we analyze the application of MCDA to service selection 
      in CC. We identify and synthesize several MCDA techniques and provide a 
      comprehensive analysis of this technology for general readers. In addition, we 
      present a taxonomy derived from a survey of the current literature. Finally, we 
      highlight several state-of-the-art practical aspects of MCDA implementation in 
      cloud computing service selection. The contributions of this study are four-fold: 
      (a) focusing on the state-of-the-art MCDA techniques, (b) highlighting the 
      comparative analysis and suitability of several MCDA methods, (c) presenting a 
      taxonomy through extensive literature review, and (d) analyzing and summarizing 
      the cloud computing service selections in different scenarios.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis Characterization of Chemical Hazard Assessment 
      Data Sources.
PG  - 895-908
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4182 [doi]
AB  - Chemical hazard assessment (CHA), which aims to investigate the inherent hazard 
      potential of chemicals, has been developed with the purpose of promoting safer 
      consumer products. Despite the increasing use of CHA in recent years, finding 
      adequate and reliable toxicity data required for CHA is still challenging due to 
      issues regarding data completeness and data quality. Also, collecting data from 
      primary toxicity reports or literature can be time consuming, which promotes the 
      use of secondary data sources instead. In this study, we evaluate and 
      characterize numerous secondary data sources on the basis of 5 performance 
      attributes: reliability, adequacy, transparency, volume, and ease of use. We use 
      GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals v1.4 as the CHA framework, which defines the 
      endpoints of interest used in this analysis. We focused upon 34 data sources that 
      reflect 3 types of secondary data: chemical-oriented data sources, 
      hazard-trait-oriented data sources, and predictive data sources. To integrate and 
      analyze the evaluation results, we applied 2 multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) methodologies: multiattribute utility theory (MAUT) and stochastic 
      multiobjective acceptability analysis (SMAA). Overall, the findings in this

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) in health care: a systematic review of the 
      main characteristics and methodological steps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The health area is one of the most affected systems on the 
      perspective of decision-making with multiobjectives, thus becoming prone to 
      errors in the final solution, however, multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) 
      appears as an aid tool for this process decision-making. Therefore,the present 
      study aims to analyze and synthesize articles found in the literature, involing 
      MCDA in health care, evaluating general issues and methodological aspects, 
      structuring them in a single work. METHODS: Surveys in the bibliographic 
      databases SCOPUS and PUBMED indicated 1852 documents on the subject, however 
      after a careful verificatios, 66 studies were selected to be analyzed completely. 
      The data extracted from the included articles were organized into a spreadsheet 
      for the preparation of analysis, and the technique used was descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: It was possible to identify a growth trend in the 
      application of the MCDA in the health area, but no dominance was identified in 
      relation to the authors of the publication and the periodicals where they are 
      published, but some countries stood out in terms of the number of published 
      researches, such as: Canada and Turkey. In defining the decision problem, and in 
      defining criteria, the "literature" presented the greatest demand for those who 
      wish to structure their decision problem. Finally, it was verified by the 
      analysis of the problem, that the MCDA to solve the problems of ranking has 
      comprehensive application and that there is a greater incidence in the use of the 
      AHP and Logic methods Fuzzy. CONCLUSION: With this, it is possible to observe, 
      through the data of this review, that more than the multicriteria methods, the 
      multicriteria decision model has been highlighted, also in the health area. In 
      addition, the study can guide new applications and techniques using MCDA in the 
      health care.

AB  - AIM: Criteria weighting is a key element of multicriteria decision analysis that 
      is becoming extensively used in healthcare decision-making. In our narrative 
      review we describe the advantages and disadvantages of various weighting methods. 
      METHODS: An assessment of the eight identified primary criteria weighting methods 
      was compiled on domains including their resource requirements, and potential for 
      bias. RESULTS: In general, we found more complex methods to have less potential 
      for bias; however, resource intensity and general participant burden is greater 
      for these methods. CONCLUSION: The selection of the most appropriate method 
      depends on the decision-making context. The simple multiattribute rating 
      technique (SMART) method combined with swing-weighting technique and the analytic 
      hierarchy process methods may be the most feasible approaches for low- and 
      middle-income countries.

AB  - Biomass obtained from microalgae research studies gained momentum in recent years 
      because of their extensive application potential in multiple industries such as 
      high-value nutraceuticals, bioproducts, cosmetics, animal feed industries, and 
      biofuels while being a sustainable and environmentally friendly option. Although 
      they have high biomass yields and rapid growth rates there are some limitations 
      and challenges that remain for large-scale commercialized cultivation and 
      harvesting methods of microalgae. Since there are multiple pathways related to 
      efficient cultivation and harvesting methods to be viable, this study adopted, 
      TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), a 
      multicriteria decision-making tool, to find the most acceptable alternative by 
      using excel spreadsheets to evaluate the information that is derived from 
      literature and pilot-scale studies. As a result, tubular (helical) and plate 
      (flat panel) photobioreactors (PBRs) for cultivation and chemical harvesting 
      (with chitosan) and bio-flocculation for harvesting were deemed suitable, while 
      plastic bag PBR and suspended air flotation were deemed unsuitable.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) applied to three long-term prophylactic

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease that impairs 
      quality of life and could be life-threatening. The aim of this study was to apply 
      a multicriteria decision analysis to assess the value of three long-term 
      prophylactic (LTP) therapies for HAE in Spain. METHODS: A multidisciplinary 
      committee of 10 experts assessed the value of lanadelumab (subcutaneous use), 
      C1-inhibitor (C1-INH; intravenous), and danazol (orally), using placebo as 
      comparator. We followed the EVIDEM methodology that considers a set of 13 
      quantitative criteria. The overall estimated value of each intervention was 
      obtained combining the weighting of each criterion with the scoring of each 
      intervention in each criterion. We used two alternative weighting methods: 
      hierarchical point allocation (HPA) and direct rating scale (DRS). A reevaluation 
      of weightings and scores was performed. RESULTS: Lanadelumab obtained higher mean 
      scores than C1-INH and danazol in all criteria, except for the cost of the 
      intervention and clinical practice guidelines. Under the HPA method, the 
      estimated values were 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.58) for 
      lanadelumab, 0.47 (95%CI: 0.41-0.53) for C1-INH, and 0.31 (95%CI: 0.24-0.39) for 
      danazol. Similar results were obtained with the DRS method: 0.51 (95%CI: 
      0.42-0.60), 0.47 (95%CI: 0.40-0.54), and 0.27 (95%CI: 0.18-0.37), respectively. 
      The comparative cost of the intervention was the only criterion that contributed 
      negatively to the values of lanadelumab and C1-INH. For danazol, four criteria 
      contributed negatively, mainly comparative safety. CONCLUSION: Lanadelumab was 
      assessed as a high-value intervention, better than C1-INH and substantially 
      better than danazol for LTP treatment of HAE.

TI  - Suitability of Preference Methods Across the Medical Product Lifecycle: A 
      Multicriteria Decision Analysis.
LID - S1098-3015(22)04751-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2022.11.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to understand the importance of criteria describing 
      methods (eg, duration, costs, validity, and outcomes) according to decision 
      makers for each decision point in the medical product lifecycle (MPLC) and to 
      determine the suitability of a discrete choice experiment, swing weighting, 
      probabilistic threshold technique, and best-worst scale cases 1 and 2 at each 
      decision point in the MPLC. METHODS: Applying multicriteria decision analysis, an 
      online survey was sent to MPLC decision makers (ie, industry, regulatory, and 
      health technology assessment representatives). They ranked and weighted 19 
      methods criteria from an existing performance matrix about their respective 
      decisions across the MPLC. All criteria were given a relative weight based on the 
      ranking and rating in the survey after which an overall suitability score was 
      calculated for each preference elicitation method per decision point. Sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty in the performance matrix. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-nine industry, 29 regulatory, and 5 health technology assessment 
      representatives completed the surveys. Overall, "estimating trade-offs between 
      treatment characteristics" and "estimating weights for treatment characteristics" 
      were highly important criteria throughout all MPLC decision points, whereas other 
      criteria were most important only for specific MPLC stages. Swing weighting and 
      probabilistic threshold technique received significantly higher suitability 
      scores across decision points than other methods. Sensitivity analyses showed 
      substantial impact of uncertainty in the performance matrix. CONCLUSION: Although 
      discrete choice experiment is the most applied preference elicitation method, 
      other methods should also be considered to address the needs of decision makers. 
      Development of evidence-based guidance documents for designing, conducting, and 
      analyzing such methods could enhance their use.

TI  - A Multicriteria Decision Analysis Comparing Pharmacotherapy for Chronic 
      Neuropathic Pain, Including Cannabinoids and Cannabis-Based Medical Products.
PG  - 482-500
LID - 10.1089/can.2020.0129 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pharmacological management of chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) still 
      represents a major clinical challenge. Collective harnessing of both the 
      scientific evidence base and clinical experience (of clinicians and patients) can 
      play a key role in informing treatment pathways and contribute to the debate on 
      specific treatments (e.g., cannabinoids). A group of expert clinicians (pain 
      specialists and psychiatrists), scientists, and patient representatives convened 
      to assess the relative benefit-safety balance of 12 pharmacological treatments, 
      including orally administered cannabinoids/cannabis-based medicinal products, for 
      the treatment of CNP in adults. Methods: A decision conference provided the 
      process of creating a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model, in which the 
      group collectively scored the drugs on 17 effect criteria relevant to benefits 
      and safety and then weighted the criteria for their clinical relevance. Findings: 
      Cannabis-based medicinal products consisting of tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol 
      (THC/CBD), in a 1:1 ratio, achieved the highest overall score, 79 (out of 100), 
      followed by CBD dominant at 75, then THC dominant at 72. Duloxetine and the 
      gabapentinoids scored in the 60s, amitriptyline, tramadol, and ibuprofen in the 
      50s, methadone and oxycodone in the 40s, and morphine and fentanyl in the 30s. 
      Sensitivity analyses showed that even if the pain reduction and quality-of-life 
      scores for THC/CBD and THC are halved, their benefit-safety balances remain 
      better than those of the noncannabinoid drugs. Interpretation: The benefit-safety 
      profiles for cannabinoids were higher than for other commonly used medications 
      for CNP largely because they contribute more to quality of life and have a more 
      favorable side effect profile. The results also reflect the shortcomings of 
      alternative pharmacological treatments with respect to safety and mitigation of 
      neuropathic pain symptoms. Further high-quality clinical trials and systematic 
      comprehensive capture of clinical experience with cannabinoids is warranted. 
      These results demonstrate once again the complexity and multimodal mechanisms 
      underlying the clinical experience and impact of chronic pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent to which stated preferences for treatment 
      criteria elicited using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are 
      consistent with the trade-offs (implicitly) applied in cost-effectiveness 
      analysis (CEA), and the impact of any differences on the prioritization of 
      treatments. METHODS: We used existing MCDA and CEA models developed to evaluate 
      interventions for knee osteoarthritis in the New Zealand population. We 
      established equivalent input parameters for each model, for the criteria 
      "treatment effectiveness," "cost," "risk of serious harms," and "risk of 
      mild-to-moderate harms" across a comprehensive range of (hypothetical) 
      interventions to produce a complete ranking of interventions from each model. We 
      evaluated the consistency of these rankings between the 2 models and investigated 
      any systematic differences between the (implied) weight placed on each criterion 
      in determining rankings. RESULTS: There was an overall moderate-to-strong 
      correlation in intervention rankings between the MCDA and CEA models (Spearman 
      correlation coefficient = 0.51). Nevertheless, there were systematic differences 
      in the evaluation of trade-offs between intervention attributes and the resulting 
      weights placed on each criterion. The CEA model placed lower weights on risks of 
      harm and much greater weight on cost (at all accepted levels of 
      willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted life-year than did respondents to the 
      MCDA survey. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA and CEA approaches to inform intervention 
      prioritization may give systematically different results, even when considering 
      the same criteria and input data. These differences should be considered when 
      designing and interpreting such studies to inform treatment prioritization 
      decisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the FeminFER project was to assess the value of 
      ferric carboxymaltose following a multicriteria decision analysis in obstetrics 
      and gynaecology in Spain. METHODS: Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and ferrous 
      sulphate were evaluated using the EVIDEM framework. Ten stakeholders participated 
      to collect different perspectives. The framework was adapted considering evidence 
      retrieved with a PICO-S search strategy and grey literature. Criteria/subcriteria 
      were weighted by level of relevance and an evidence-based decision-making 
      exercise was developed in each criterion; weights and scores were combined to 
      obtain the value of intervention relative to each criterion/subcriterion, that 
      were further combined into the Modulated Relative Benefit-Risk Balance (MRBRB). 
      RESULTS: The most important criterion favouring FCM was Compared 
      Efficacy/Effectiveness (0.183 ± 0.07), followed by Patient Preferences 
      (0.059 ± 0.10). Only Direct medical costs criterion favoured FS (-0.003 ± 0.03). 
      MRBRB favoured FCM; 0.45 ± 0.19; in a scale from -1 to + 1. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, considering the several criteria involved in the decision-making 
      process, participants agreed with the use of FCM according to its MRBRB.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision-Making Methods for Optimal Treatment Selection in Network 
      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 78-90
LID - 10.1177/0272989X221126678 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Network meta-analysis exploits randomized data to compare multiple 
      interventions and generate rankings. Selecting an optimal treatment may be 
      complicated when multiple conflicting outcomes are evaluated in parallel. DESIGN: 
      The present study suggested the incorporation of multicriteria decision-making 
      methods in network meta-analyses to select the best intervention when multiple 
      outcomes are of interest by creating partial and absolute rankings with the 
      TOPSIS, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE algorithms. The TOPSIS and VIKOR techniques 
      represent distance-based methods for compromise intervention selection, whereas 
      the PROMETHEE analysis method allows the definition of preference and 
      indifference thresholds. In addition, the PROMETHEE technique allows a variety of 
      modeling options by selecting alternative preference functions. Different weights 
      may be applied to outcomes objectively with the entropy method as well as 
      subjectively with the analytic hierarchy process, enabling the individualization 
      of treatment choice depending on the clinical scenario. RESULTS: Visualization of 
      decision analysis may be performed with multicriteria score-adjusted 
      scatterplots, while league tables may be constructed to depict the PROMETHEE I 
      partial ordering of interventions. A simulated study was performed assuming equal 
      weights of outcomes, and the TOPSIS, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE II methods were 
      compared using a similarity coefficient, indicating a high degree of agreement 
      among methods, especially with higher numbers of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Multicriteria decision analysis provides a flexible and computationally direct 
      way of selecting compromise interventions and visualizing treatment selection in 
      network meta-analyses. Further research should provide empirical data about the 
      implementation of multicriteria decision analysis in real-world network 
      meta-analyses aiming to define the most suitable method depending on the clinical 
      question. HIGHLIGHTS: Multicriteria decision-making methods can be implemented in 
      network meta-analysis to indicate compromise interventions.The TOPSIS, VIKOR, and 
      PROMETHEE methods can be used for optimal treatment selection when conflicting 
      outcomes are evaluated.The weights of outcomes can be defined objectively or 
      subjectively, reflecting the priorities of the decision maker.

TI  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis Applied to Sponge City Construction in China: A 
      Case Study.
PG  - 703-713
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4163 [doi]
AB  - To address stormwater management, China initiated the construction of sponge 
      cities (SPCs) in 2014. Sponge city construction in China has previously been 
      evaluated using subjective expert methods. Based on China's SPC evaluation 
      regulations, the evaluation criteria system was divided into 6 categories and 22 
      indicators. This study presents a multicriteria approach to evaluating SPC 
      construction through multicriteria attributes value theory (MAVT). Coupled with 
      the entropy method, this approach can reduce errors caused by individual methods. 
      This work improved the evaluation method from a subjective to an objective 
      method. Additionally, the sensitivity of an alternative to these criteria was 
      conducted. The analysis reveals the inner relationship between the SPC 
      alternative and the criteria. The city of Hebi, an actual SPC project, was 
      selected as a case study. The findings indicate that the proposed approach is 
      efficient and simple. It can help decision makers better understand SPC 
      performance, and it is a pilot SPC evaluation method using relatively objective 
      means. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:703-713. © 2019 SETAC.

TI  - GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis for settlement areas: a case study in 
      Canik.
PG  - 35746-35759
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-17970-w [doi]
AB  - In addition to global population growth due to migration from rural areas to 
      urban areas, population density is constantly increasing in certain regions, 
      thereby necessitating the introduction of new settlements in these regions. 
      However, in the selection of settlement areas, no sufficient preliminary 
      examinations have been conducted; consequently, various natural disasters may 
      cause significant life and property losses. Herein, the most suitable settlement 
      areas were determined using GIS (geographic information systems) in Canik 
      District, where the population is continuously increasing. Therefore, this study 
      aimed to incorporate a new perspective into studies on this subject. Within the 
      scope of the study, landslide and flood risks, which are among the most important 
      natural disasters in the region, were primarily evaluated, and high-risk areas 
      were determined. Elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, topographic 
      humidity index (TWI), and proximity to river parameters were used to produce 
      flood susceptibility maps. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area was 
      produced using contours on the 1/25,000 scaled topographic map. The elevation, 
      slope, aspect, curvature, and TWI parameters were produced from the DEM using the 
      relevant analysis routines of ArcGIS software. The raster map of each parameter 
      was divided into 5 subclasses using the natural breaks classification method. In 
      the reclassified raster maps, the most flood-sensitive or flood-prone subclasses 
      were assigned a value of 5, and the least sensitive subclasses were assigned a 
      value of 1. Then, the reclassified maps of the 7 parameters were collected using 
      the "map algebra" function of ArcGIS 10.5 software, and the flood susceptibility 
      index (FSI) map of the study area was obtained. The flood susceptibility map of 
      the study area was obtained by dividing the FSI into 5 subclasses (very low, low, 
      moderate, high, and very high) according to the natural breaks classification 
      method. Thereafter, suitable and unsuitable areas in terms of biocomfort, which 
      affects people's health, peace, comfort, and psychology and is significant in 
      terms of energy efficiency, were determined. At the last stage of the study, the 
      most suitable settlement areas that were suitable in terms of both biocomfort and 
      low levels of landslide and flood risks were determined. The calculated 
      proportion of such areas to the total study area was only 2.1%. Therefore, 
      because these areas were insufficient for the establishment of new settlements, 
      areas that had low landslide and flood risks but were unsuitable for biocomfort 
      were secondarily determined; the ratio of these areas was calculated as 56.8%. 
      The remaining areas were inconvenient for the establishment of settlements due to 
      the risk of landslides and floods; the ratio of these areas was calculated as 
      41.1%. This study is exemplary in that the priority for the selection of 
      settlement areas was specified, and this method can be applied for selecting new 
      settlements for each region considering different criteria. Due to the risk of 
      landslides or flooding in the study area, the areas unsuitable for establishing a 
      settlement covered approximately 41.1% of the total study area. The areas that 
      had low flood and landslide risks but were suitable for biocomfort constituted 
      only 2.1% of the study area. In approximately 56.8% of the study area, the risk 
      of landslides or floods was low, and these areas were unsuitable in terms of 
      biocomfort. Therefore, these areas were secondarily preferred as settlement 
      areas. The most suitable areas for settlements constituted only 0.19% of the 
      total study area, and these areas will not be able to meet the increasing demand 
      for settlement area. Therefore, it is recommended to select areas that do not 
      have the risk of landslides and floods but are unsuitable for biocomfort. This 
      study reveals that grading should be performed in the selection of settlement 
      areas. When choosing a settlement area in any region, possible natural disasters 
      in the region should be identified first, and these disasters should be ordered 
      in terms of their threat potential. Moreover, biocomfort areas suitable for 
      settlements should be considered. In the next stages of settlement area 
      selection, the criteria that affect the peace and comfort of people, such as 
      distance to pollution sources, distance to noise sources, and proximity to 
      natural areas, should also be evaluated. Thus, a priority order should be created 
      for the selection of settlement areas using various other criteria.

TI  - A multi-stakeholder multicriteria decision analysis for the reimbursement of 
      orphan drugs (FinMHU-MCDA study).
PG  - 186

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient access to orphan medicinal products (OMPs) is limited and 
      varies between countries, reimbursement decisions on OMPs are complex, and there 
      is a need for more transparent processes to know which criteria should be 
      considered to inform these decisions. This study aimed to determine the most 
      relevant criteria for the reimbursement of OMPs in Spain, from a 
      multi-stakeholder perspective, and using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). 
      METHODS: An MCDA was developed in 3 phases and included 28 stakeholders closely 
      related to the field of rare diseases (6 physicians, 5 hospital pharmacists, 7 
      health economists, 4 patient representatives and 6 members from national and 
      regional health authorities). Initially [phase A], a bibliographic review was 
      conducted to identify the potential reimbursement criteria. Then, a reduced 
      advisory board (8 members) proposed, selected, and defined the final list of 
      criteria that could be relevant for reimbursement. A discrete choice experiment 
      (DCE) [phase B] was developed to determine the relevance and relative importance 
      weight of such criteria according to the stakeholders' preferences by choosing 
      between pairs of hypothetical financing scenarios. A multinomial logit model was 
      fitted to analyze the DCE responses. Finally [phase C], the advisory board review 
      the results using a deliberative process. RESULTS: Thirteen criteria were 
      selected, related to 4 dimensions: patient population, disease, treatment, and 
      economic evaluation. Nine criteria were deemed relevant for decision-making and 
      associated with a higher relative importance: Health-related quality of life 
      (HRQL) (23.53%), treatment efficacy (14.64%), availability of treatment 
      alternatives (13.51%), disease severity (12.62%), avoided costs (11.21%), age of 
      target population (7.75%), safety (seriousness of adverse events) (4.72%), 
      quality of evidence (3.82%) and size of target population (3.12%). The remaining 
      criteria had a < 3% relative importance: economic burden of disease (2.50%), cost 
      of treatment (1.73%), cost-effectiveness (0.83%) and safety (frequency of adverse 
      events) (0.03%). CONCLUSION: The reimbursement of OMPs in Spain should be 
      determined by its effect on patient's HRQL, the extent of its therapeutic benefit 
      from efficacy and the availability of other therapeutic options. Furthermore, the 
      severity of the rare disease should also influence the decision along with the 
      potential of the treatment to avoid associated costs.

TI  - Moving Beyond Quality-Adjusted Life-Years in Elderly Care: How Can Multicriteria 
      Decision Analysis Complement Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Local-Level Decision 
      Making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) could complement cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to support investment 
      decisions in elderly care at local level. METHODS: We used an integrated elderly 
      care program in The Netherlands as a case study to demonstrate the application of 
      both methods. In a 12-month quasi-experimental study (n = 384), data on the 
      following outcome measures were collected: quality-adjusted life-years (CEA) and 
      physical functioning, psychological well-being, social relationships and 
      participation, enjoyment of life, resilience, person centeredness, continuity of 
      care, and costs (MCDA). We performed regression analysis on inversed probability 
      weighted data and controlled for potential confounders to obtain a double robust 
      estimate of the outcomes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined 
      uncertainty for both methods. RESULTS: The integrated elderly care program was 
      not likely (ie, 36%) to be cost-effective according to the CEA (incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios: €88 249 from a societal perspective) using the 
      conventional Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold (ie, €50 000). The MCDA 
      demonstrated that informal caregivers and professionals slightly preferred the 
      intervention over usual care, driven by enjoyment of life and person 
      centeredness. Patients did not prefer either the intervention or usual care, 
      whereas payers and policy makers slightly preferred usual care, mainly due to 
      higher costs of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA could provide local-level 
      decision makers with a broader measurement of effectiveness by including outcomes 
      beyond health and longevity and the preferences of multiple stakeholders. This 
      additional information could foster the acceptability and implementability of 
      cost-effective innovations in elderly care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prioritise vaccines for introduction in Bangladesh. METHODS: 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) process was used to prioritise potential 
      vaccines for introduction in Bangladesh. A set of criteria were identified, 
      weighted and assigned scores by relevant stakeholders (n=14) during workshop A. 
      The performance matrix of the data of vaccines against the criteria set was 
      constructed and validated with the experts (n=6) in workshop B. The vaccines were 
      ranked and appraised by another group of stakeholders (n=10) in workshop C, and 
      the final workshop D involved the dissemination of the findings to 
      decision-makers (n=28). RESULTS: Five criteria including incidence rate, case 
      fatality rate, vaccine efficacy, size of the population at risk and type of 
      population at risk were used quantitatively to evaluate and to score the 
      vaccines. Two other criteria, cost-effectiveness and outbreak potentiality, were 
      considered qualitatively. On deliberation, the Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine 
      was ranked top to be recommended for introduction in Bangladesh. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on the MCDA results, JE vaccine is planned to be recommended to the 
      decision-makers for introduction into the national vaccine benefit package. The 
      policymakers support the use of systematic evidence-based decision-making 
      processes such as MCDA for vaccine introduction in Bangladesh, and to prioritise 
      health interventions in the country.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of amphotericin B formulations: a network meta-analysis and a 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1672-1683
LID - 10.1111/jphp.12802 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite its broad spectrum, conventional amphotericin B (AB) is 
      associated with serious adverse events. Lipid-based formulations may offer safer 
      options. We aimed to synthesize the evidence of efficacy and safety of AB 
      formulations. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis 
      (NMA) to compare all available formulations: conventional AB; lipid complex or 
      ABLC; colloidal dispersion or ABCD; liposomal or LAB; AB in Intralipid. 
      Randomized controlled trials were searched in four databases. Cure, fever, 
      chills, nephrotoxicity, death and drug discontinuation were assessed. NMA was 
      based on Bayesian methods accounting for direct and indirect comparisons. 
      Probability ranks estimating the best formulation were built for each outcome. 
      The relative benefit-risk of formulations was assessed with stochastic 
      multicriteria acceptability analyses (SMAA). KEY FINDINGS: We identified 25 
      trials (n = 2996). No significant differences among drugs were observed for cure 
      or death. All lipid-based formulations were safer than conventional AB for 
      nephrotoxicity. AB-Intralipid was more tolerable than conventional AB and caused 
      less chills than ABCD. AB-Intralipid was the best therapy (>60%) regarding 
      nephrotoxicity, fever, chills and discontinuation. The scenario from SMAA 
      favoured AB-Intralipid (81% acceptability). Conventional AB was secondary to all 
      lipid-based formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B-Intralipid was identified 
      as safer, cost-saving treatment in comparison with other formulations.

TI  - Dengue risk assessment using multicriteria decision analysis: A case study of 
      Bhutan.
PG  - e0009021
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009021 [doi]
LID - e0009021
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease globally, 
      with a 30-fold increase in global incidence over the last 50 years. In Bhutan, 
      dengue incidence has been on the rise since 2004, with numerous outbreaks 
      reported across the country. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas 
      that are vulnerable to dengue in Bhutan. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We 
      conducted a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a weighted linear 
      combination (WLC) to obtain a vulnerability map of dengue. Risk factors 
      (criteria) were identified and assigned with membership values for vulnerability 
      according to the available literature. Sensitivity analysis and validation of the 
      model was conducted to improve the robustness and predictive ability of the map. 
      Our study revealed marked differences in geographical vulnerability to dengue by 
      location and season. Low-lying areas and those located along the southern border 
      were consistently found to be at higher risk of dengue. The vulnerability 
      extended to higher elevation areas including some areas in the Capital city 
      Thimphu during the summer season. The higher risk was mostly associated with 
      relatively high population density, agricultural and built-up landscapes and 
      relatively good road connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using MCDA, our study identified 
      vulnerable areas in Bhutan during specific seasons when and where the 
      transmission of dengue is most likely to occur. This study provides evidence for 
      the National Vector-borne Disease Control programme to optimize the use of 
      limited public health resources for surveillance and vector control, to mitigate 
      the public health threat of dengue.

TI  - The Role of Decision Analysis in Risk Analysis: A Retrospective.
PG  - 2207-2217
LID - 10.1111/risa.13583 [doi]
AB  - In commemorating the 40th anniversary of Risk Analysis, this article takes a 
      retrospective look at some of the ways in which decision analysis (as a "sibling 
      field") has contributed to the development both of the journal, and of risk 
      analysis as a field. I begin with some early foundational papers from the first 
      decade of the journal's history. I then review a number of papers that have 
      applied decision analysis to risk problems over the years, including applications 
      of related methods such as influence diagrams, multicriteria decision analysis, 
      and risk matrices. The article then reviews some recent trends, from roughly the 
      last five years, and concludes with observations about the parallel evolution of 
      risk analysis and decision analysis over the decades-especially with regard to 
      the importance of representing multiple stakeholder perspectives, and the 
      importance of behavioral realism in decision models. Overall, the extensive 
      literature surveyed here supports the view that the incorporation of 
      decision-analytic perspectives has improved the practice of risk analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support health technology assessment 
      (HTA) agencies for setting healthcare priorities. However, its implementation to 
      date has been criticized for being "entirely mechanistic," ignoring opportunity 
      costs, and not following best practice guidelines. This article provides guidance 
      on the use of MCDA in this context. METHODS: The present study was based on a 
      systematic review and consensus development. We developed a typology of MCDA 
      studies and good implementation practice. We reviewed 36 studies over the period 
      1990 to 2018 on their compliance with good practice and developed 
      recommendations. We reached consensus among authors over the course of several 
      review rounds. RESULTS: We identified 3 MCDA study types: qualitative MCDA, 
      quantitative MCDA, and MCDA with decision rules. The types perform differently in 
      terms of quality, consistency, and transparency of recommendations on healthcare 
      priorities. We advise HTA agencies to always include a deliberative component. 
      Agencies should, at a minimum, undertake qualitative MCDA. The use of 
      quantitative MCDA has additional benefits but also poses design challenges. MCDA 
      with decision rules, used by HTA agencies in The Netherlands and the United 
      Kingdom and typically referred to as structured deliberation, has the potential 
      to further improve the formulation of recommendations but has not yet been 
      subjected to broad experimentation and evaluation. CONCLUSION: MCDA holds large 
      potential to support HTA agencies in setting healthcare priorities, but its 
      implementation needs to be improved.

TI  - Comparison of Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Prevention in Nonvalvular Atrial 
      Fibrillation: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decision on the most appropriate oral anticoagulation therapy for 
      stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is difficult 
      because multiple treatment options are available, and these vary in their 
      clinical effects and relevant nonclinical characteristics. OBJECTIVES: To use a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare the oral anticoagulants 
      apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and vitamin K antagonist (VKAs; 
      specifically warfarin) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. METHODS: 
      We identified the evaluation criteria through a targeted literature review and 
      clinical judgment. The final evaluation model included nine clinical events and 
      four other criteria. We ranked possibly fatal clinical event criteria on the 
      basis of the differences in risks of fatal events and the corresponding window of 
      therapeutic opportunity, as observed in clinical trials. Clinical judgment was 
      used to rank other criteria. Full criteria ranking was used to calculate centroid 
      weights, which were combined with individual treatment performances to estimate 
      the overall value score for each treatment. RESULTS: Using such an MCDA, 
      dabigatran yielded the highest overall value, approximately 6% higher than that 
      of the second-best treatment, apixaban. Dabigatran also had the highest 
      first-rank probability (0.72) in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. 
      Rivaroxaban performed worse than the other non-VKA oral anticoagulants, but 
      better than VKAs (with both having 0.00 first-rank probability). The results were 
      insensitive to changes in model structure. CONCLUSIONS: When all key oral 
      anticoagulant value criteria and their relative importance are investigated in an 
      MCDA, dabigatran appears to rank the highest and warfarin the lowest.

TI  - Additive Multicriteria Decision Analysis Models: Misleading Aids for 
      Life-Critical Shared Decision Making.
PG  - 437-449
LID - 10.1177/0272989X19844740 [doi]
AB  - Background. There is growing interest in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      for shared decision making (SDM). A distinguishing feature is that a preferred 
      treatment should extend years of life and/or improve health-related quality of 
      life (HRQL). Additive MCDA models are inadequate for the task. A plethora of MCDA 
      models exist, each claiming that it can correctly solve real-world problems. 
      However, most were developed in nonhealth fields and rely on additive models. 
      This makes the problem of choosing an MCDA model as an aid for SDM a challenging 
      and urgent one. Methods. A published 2017 MCDA of a hypothetical prostate cancer 
      patient is used as a case in point of how not to do and how to do MCDA for SDM. 
      We critically review it and analyze it using several additive linear MCDA models 
      with years of life and HRQL as attributes and the linear quality-adjusted 
      life-year (QALY) model. The following simple reasonableness test is presented for 
      applicability of a method as an aid for SDM: Can a treatment that causes 
      premature death trump a treatment that causes acceptable adverse effects? 
      Results. Additive MCDA models and the linear QALY recommend significantly 
      different alternatives. Additive MCDA models fail the proposed reasonableness 
      test; the linear QALY model passes. Conclusions. MCDA possesses a strong craft 
      element in addition to its technical aspects. MCDA practitioners and clinicians 
      need to understand model limitations to choose models appropriate to the context. 
      Additive MCDA models are inadequate for life-critical SDM. We advocate QALY 
      models with additional research for increased realism as a tool for SDM.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis process to develop new classification criteria 
      for systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 634-640
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-214685 [doi]
AB  - European League Against Rheumatism and are jointly supporting multiphase 
      development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria based 
      on weighted criteria and a continuous probability scale. Prior steps included 
      item generation, item reduction and hierarchical organisation of candidate 
      criteria using an evidence-based approach. Our objectives were to determine 
      relative weights using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and to set a 
      provisional threshold score for SLE classification. An SLE Expert Panel (8 
      European, 9 North American) submitted 164 real, unique cases with a wide range of 
      SLE probability in a standardised format. Using the candidate criteria, experts 
      scored and rank-ordered 20 representative cases. At an in-person meeting, experts 
      reviewed inter-rater reliability of scoring, further refined criteria definitions 
      and participated in an MCDA exercise. Based on expert consensus decisions on 
      pairwise comparisons of criteria, 1000minds software calculated criteria weights 
      and rank-ordered the remaining 144 cases based on their additive scores. The 
      score of the lowest-ranked case for which complete expert consensus was achieved 
      defined the provisional threshold classification score. Inter-rater reliability 
      of scoring cases with the candidate criteria was good. MCDA involved 74 pairwise 
      decisions and was repeated for the arthritis and mucocutaneous domains when the 
      initial ranking of some cases did not match expert opinion. After criteria 
      weights and additive scores were recalculated once, experts reached consensus for 
      SLE classification for all cases scoring>83. Using an iterative process, the 
      candidate criteria definitions were refined, preliminary weights were calculated 
      and a provisional threshold score for SLE classification was determined.

TI  - Early Access to Medicines: Use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) as a 
      Decision Tool in Catalonia (Spain).
LID - 10.3390/jcm11051353 [doi]
LID - 1353
AB  - Early access to medicines allows the prescription of a medicine before it is 
      available in the public formulary to patients with severe or rare diseases with 
      high unmet needs who have no authorised therapeutic alternatives available. In 
      this context, consistent decision making is difficult, and a systematic 
      assessment procedure could be useful to tackle complex situations and guarantee 
      the equity of medicines' access. A multidisciplinary panel (MP) conducted four 
      workshops to develop an early access framework based on a reflective multiple 
      criteria decision analysis (MCDA). A set of 12 criteria was agreed: eight 
      quantitative (severity of disease, urgency, efficacy, safety, internal and 
      external validity, therapeutic benefit and plausibility) and four qualitative 
      (therapeutic alternative, existence of precedents, management impact and costs). 
      Quantitative criteria were weighted using a five-point scale. The relative 
      importance of quantitative criteria had mean weights from 4.7 to 3.6, showing its 
      relevance in the decisions. The framework was tested using two case studies, and 
      reliability was assessed by re-test. The re-test revealed no statistical 
      differences, indicating the consistency and replicability of the framework 
      developed. MCDA may help to structure discussions for heterogeneous treatment 
      requests, providing predictability and robustness in decision making involving 
      sensitive and complex situations.

      drugs value in the Catalan Health Service (CatSalut).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Orphan medicines show some characteristics that hinder the evaluation 
      of their clinical added value. The often low level of evidence available for 
      orphan drugs, together with a high budget impact and an incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio many times higher than drugs used for non-orphan 
      diseases, represent challenges in their appraisal and effective access to 
      clinical use. In order to explore how to handle these hurdles, the Catalan Health 
      Service (CatSalut) began an initiative on a multidimensional assessment of drugs 
      value during the appraisal process. Reflective multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) using analytical methods was chosen, since it may help to standardise and 
      contextualize all the relevant data related with the drug that could contribute 
      to a decision. The aim of the study was to determine whether the implementation 
      of reflective MCDA methodology could support the decision-making process about 
      orphan medicines in the context of CatSalut. METHODS: The assessment and 
      decision-making process for orphan drugs in the Programa d'Harmonització 
      Farmacoterapeutica (PHF) of CatSalut was prioritized to test the implementation 
      of the reflective MCDA both a qualitative and quantitatively. A staged approach 
      was used with the following main steps: selection and structuration of 
      quantitative criteria (Core Model) and qualitative criteria (Contextual Tool), 
      framework scoring and assessment of three orphan drug case studies. This 
      proof-of-concept would grant a continued refinement of the methodology and, if 
      and when validated, its potential integration to other therapeutic areas of the 
      PHF. RESULTS: The final framework was composed by 10 quantitative criteria (Core 
      Model) and 4 qualitative criteria (Contextual Tool) according to the PHF goals 
      being the most important criteria "disease severity", "unmet need", "comparative 
      effectiveness" and "comparative safety /tolerability". The matrix developed for 
      the case studies served as a guide for the selection of the essential information 
      that the decision-makers were expected to include in a framework. The reflective 
      discussion was considered the most relevant phase of the approach to support 
      inputs for health decision-making processes reflecting both drug value and place 
      in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that reflective MCDA methodology could 
      be implemented to complement the decision-making process in CatSalut, as an aid 
      to determine the clinical added value for orphan medicines. MCDA provided 
      transparency and a structured discussion during the committee meetings, thus 
      increasing transparency and predictability of the relevant items supporting the 
      agreements adopted on orphan drugs access.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple approach for evaluating the overall benefit-risk 
      of a new noninferiority treatment compared with a standard of care. METHODS: We 
      propose using multicriteria decision analysis that accounts for uncertainty 
      associated with both clinical outcomes and patient preference data. Because 
      patients' preferences are likely to be influenced by their baseline 
      characteristics, we suggest carrying out a preference study at the beginning of a 
      trial. To reduce the burden of an additional study questionnaire, preference 
      elicitation could be done on a small sample of trial participants. To restore 
      preferences for all trial participants, we propose using multiple imputation 
      (MI). Using simulations, we examine whether 3 different MI procedures lead to the 
      same benefit-risk assessment conclusion, as if all trial participant preferences 
      were obtained. We also compare MI results to complete case analysis, where only 
      preferences of the small sample of trial participants are considered. RESULTS: We 
      show that the MI procedure successfully restores patients' preferences for the 
      trial participants using different outcome criteria and preferences. For example, 
      using 3 outcome criteria with only 10% of the trial participants providing their 
      preferences, complete case analysis demonstrated a new noninferior treatment as 
      favorable only 5.1% of the time, whereas MI procedures did so between 16.2% and 
      17.9% of the time. Given that 17.6% correspond to the fully observed weights, the 
      MI methods demonstrate favorable results. CONCLUSIONS: The MI procedure can help 
      facilitate a simple comprehensive benefit-risk assessment for new noninferior 
      treatments.

TI  - Site selection of municipal solid waste incineration plant using GIS and 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1027-1039
LID - 10.1080/10962247.2022.2064002 [doi]
AB  - Fast population growth and urbanization has increased the generation of municipal 
      solid waste in Oman. Currently, Oman relies on landfills to handle growing 
      amounts of waste, which has burdened the existing solid waste management 
      infrastructure. This situation calls for establishing incineration plants that 
      can considerably reduce the volume of waste, and can simultaneously produce 
      electricity. However, one of the crucial steps in the planning of an incineration 
      plant is the selection of an appropriate site that can overcome environmental and 
      economic implications and eliminate community dissatisfaction. Therefore, to 
      select an optimal site for incineration plant in Muscat and South Batinah 
      governorates, where landfills receive the highest waste amounts per day, this 
      research identified 11 criteria that cover the environmental, economic, and 
      social concerns. These criteria were processed by combining the multicriteria 
      decision making (MCDM) method and geographical information system (GIS) software 
      where the suitability of individual criteria were evaluated and then integrated 
      using the weighted overlay analysis to generate a final suitability map for 
      incineration site selection. The final suitability map indicated that only 2% of 
      the land is suitable for setting up an incineration plant in the study area, and 
      the most suitable location with adequate area was found in Barka wilaya of South 
      Batinah governorate.Implications: Due to the escalation in MSW generation, Oman 
      is looking for alternative strategies to reduce the volume of MSW. This has led 
      to country's interest in establishing a waste-to-energy plant (particularly 
      incineration) in the future. However, locating a suitable site for the 
      installation of an MSW incineration plant in Oman has never been studied before. 
      Therefore, to bridge the gap in knowledge, this research focuses on selecting a 
      suitable site for a municipal solid waste incineration plant using GIS and 
      multicriteria decision analysis. This study highlights the suitability of Muscat 
      and North Batinah governorates of Oman where landfills receive huge amounts of 
      MSW on a daily basis and are close to becoming saturated. Moreover, the 
      suitability of land in both governorates is assessed to overcome environmental 
      and economic implications and eliminate community dissatisfaction. This research 
      not only provides the level of suitability of land in both governorates, but also 
      selects a suitable site, which will be beneficial for the government of Oman in 
      future when making a decision regarding the location of the plant.

TI  - A Multiple Stakeholder Multicriteria Decision Analysis in Diabetic Macular Edema 
      Management: The MULTIDEX-EMD Study.
PG  - 615-624
LID - 10.1007/s41669-020-00201-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical and economic management of retinal diseases has become 
      more complex following the introduction of new intravitreal treatments. 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers the potential to overcome the 
      challenges associated with traditional decision-making tools. OBJECTIVES: A MCDA 
      to determine the most relevant criteria to decision-making in the management of 
      diabetic macular edema (DME) based on the perspectives of multiple stakeholders 
      in Spain was developed. This MCDA was termed the MULTIDEX-EMD study. METHODS: 
      Nineteen stakeholders (7 physicians, 4 pharmacists, 5 health authorities and 
      health management experts, 1 psychologist, and 2 patient representatives) 
      participated in this three-phase project. In phase A, an advisory board defined 
      all of the criteria that could influence DME treatment decision-making. These 
      criteria were then screened using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) (phase B). 
      Next, a multinomial logit model was fitted by applying the backward elimination 
      algorithm (relevant criteria: p value < 0.05). Finally, the results were 
      discussed in a deliberative process (phase C). RESULTS: Thirty-one criteria were 
      initially defined (phase A) and grouped into 5 categories: 
      efficacy/effectiveness, safety, organizational and economic impact, 
      patient-reported outcomes, and other therapeutic features. The DCE results (phase 
      B) showed that 10 criteria were relevant to the decision-making process for a 50- 
      to 65-year-old DME patient: mean change in best corrected visual acuity (p 
      value < 0.001), percentage of patients with an improvement of ≥ 15 letters (p 
      value < 0.001), effect duration per administration (p value = 0.008), retinal 
      detachment (p value < 0.001), endophthalmitis (p value = 0.012), myocardial 
      infarction (p value < 0.001), intravitreal hemorrhage (p value = 0.021), annual 
      treatment cost per patient (p value = 0.001), health-related quality of life 
      (HRQoL) (p value = 0.004), and disability level (p value = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: 
      From a multi-stakeholder perspective, the selection of an appropriate treatment 
      for DME patients should guarantee patient safety and maximize the visual acuity 
      improvement and treatment effect duration. It should also contribute to system 
      sustainability by being affordable, it should have a positive impact on HRQoL, 
      and it should prevent disability.

AB  - Decision making in food safety is a complex process that involves several 
      criteria of different nature like the expected reduction in the number of 
      illnesses, the potential economic or health-related cost, or even the 
      environmental impact of a given policy or intervention. Several multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms are currently used, mostly individually, in 
      food safety to rank different options in a multifactorial environment. However, 
      the selection of the MCDA algorithm is a decision problem on its own because 
      different methods calculate different rankings. The aim of this study was to 
      compare the impact of different uncertainty sources on the rankings of MCDA 
      problems in the context of food safety. For that purpose, a previously published 
      data set on emerging zoonoses in the Netherlands was used to compare different 
      MCDA algorithms: MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, WASPAS, and ELECTRE III. The rankings 
      were calculated with and without considering uncertainty (using fuzzy sets), to 
      assess the importance of this factor. The rankings obtained differed between 
      algorithms, emphasizing that the selection of the MCDA method had a relevant 
      impact in the rankings. Furthermore, considering uncertainty in the ranking had a 
      high influence on the results. Both factors were more relevant than the weights 
      associated with each criterion in this case study. A hierarchical clustering 
      method was suggested to aggregate results obtained by the different algorithms. 
      This complementary step seems to be a promising way to decrease extreme 
      difference among algorithms and could provide a strong added value in the 
      decision-making process.

AB  - Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used in health care 
      mainly because it moves decision-making from ad hoc to an evidence-based and 
      comprehensive process. Developing countries with more restricted financial and 
      human research capacities, however, should consider their own methods of MCDA 
      development and implementation. Areas covered: An MCDA framework to improve 
      procurement decisions of off-patent pharmaceuticals was developed for developing 
      countries and adapted to Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Vietnam during three policy 
      workshops. Based on the experience of these workshops and one joint workshop with 
      international experts and decision makers from multiple developing countries, 
      general recommendations were formulated on how to implement MCDA specifically in 
      developing countries. We provide 17 practical MCDA implementation recommendations 
      in four major areas, including (1) MCDA objectives; (2) technical considerations 
      of MCDA tool; (3) development and customization of MCDA tool and (4) policy 
      implementation of MCDA in decision-making. Expert commentary: These practical 
      MCDA recommendations for developing countries contribute to feasible, 
      transparent, stepwise, iterative and standardized decision-making in health care.

TI  - Patient involvement in reflective multicriteria decision analysis to assist 
      decision making in oncology.
PG  - 56-63
LID - 10.1017/S0266462318003641 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patient involvement in drug evaluation decision making is increasing. 
      The aim of the current study was to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) framework that would enable the inclusion of the patient perspective in 
      the selection of appropriate criteria for MCDAs being used in the value 
      assessments of oncologic drugs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to 
      identify and define criteria used in drug assessments from patient perspectives. 
      The Evidence and Value: Impact on Decision Making methodology was used to develop 
      a MCDA framework. Identified criteria were discussed by a sample of oncology 
      patient association representatives who decided which criteria were important 
      from patient perspectives. Selected criteria were rated by importance. The 
      preliminary MCDA framework was tested through the assessment of a hypothetical 
      oncology treatment. A discussion was carried out to agree on a final pilot MCDA 
      framework. RESULTS: Twenty-two criteria were extracted from the literature 
      review. After criteria discussion, sixteen criteria remained. The most important 
      criteria were comparative patient reported outcomes (PRO), comparative efficacy 
      and disease severity. After the discussion generated by the scoring of the 
      hypothetical oncology treatment, the final pilot MCDA framework included seven 
      quantitative criteria ("disease severity", "unmet needs", "comparative efficacy / 
      effectiveness", "comparative safety / tolerability", "comparative PROs", 
      "contribution of oncological innovation") and one contextual criterion 
      ("population priorities and access"). CONCLUSIONS: The present study developed a 
      pilot reflective MCDA framework that could increase patient's capability to 
      participate in the decision-making process by providing systematic drug 
      assessments from the patient perspective.

TI  - Multicriteria decisions and portfolio analysis: land acquisition for biological 
      and social objectives.
PG  - e02420
LID - 10.1002/eap.2420 [doi]
AB  - Resource allocation for land acquisition is a common multiobjective problem that 
      involves complex trade-offs. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) of the 
      U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently uses the Targeted Resource Acquisition 
      Comparison Tool (TRACT) to allocate funds from the Migratory Bird Conservation 
      Fund (MBCF; established through the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Act 
      of 1934) for land acquisition based on cost-benefit analysis, regional priority 
      rankings of candidate land parcels available for acquisition, and the overall 
      biological contribution to duck population objectives. However, current policy 
      encourages decision makers to consider societal and economic benefits of lands 
      acquired, in addition to their biological benefits to waterfowl. These decisions 
      about portfolio elements (i.e., individual land parcels) require an analysis of 
      the difficult trade-offs among multiple objectives. In the last decade the 
      application of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods has been 
      instrumental in aiding decision makers with complex multiobjective decisions. In 
      this study, we present an alternative approach to developing land-acquisition 
      portfolios using MCDA and modern portfolio theory (MPT). We describe the 
      development of a portfolio decision analysis tool using constrained optimization 
      for land-acquisition decisions by the NWRS. We outline the decision framework, 
      describe development of the prototype tool in Microsoft Excel, and test the 
      results of the tool using land parcels submitted as candidates for MBCF funding 
      in 2019. Our results indicate that the constrained optimization outperformed the 
      traditional TRACT method and ad hoc portfolios developed using current NWRS 
      criteria.

TI  - Development of a Multicriteria Decision Analysis Framework for Evaluating and 
      Positioning Oncologic Treatments in Clinical Practice.
PG  - e298-e305
LID - 10.1200/JOP.19.00487 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several frameworks have been developed to define and quantify the value 
      of oncologic therapies and to support decision making; however, they define 
      treatment value mainly in terms of clinical benefit. As part of its mission to 
      improve oncologic care, the ECO Foundation (Excellence and Quality in Oncology) 
      directed this pilot study aimed at developing a reflective multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA)-based framework for evaluating and positioning oncologic drugs in 
      the clinical setting. METHODS: The framework was developed following Evidence and 
      Value: Impact on Decision-Making methodology, and literature was reviewed to 
      identify relevant criteria. The selected criteria were then presented to a group 
      of experts composed of 9 clinical oncologists who assessed each criterion for 
      inclusion in the framework and suggested modifications in their definition and/or 
      response scale. The framework was tested in 2 case studies (abemaciclib for 
      advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
      receptor 2-negative breast cancer and TAS-102 for metastatic colorectal cancer) 
      to validate the proposed framework; this was followed by a discussion of the 
      results. RESULTS: Eight of the 15 criteria presented to the experts were included 
      in the framework: disease severity, unmet needs, comparative efficacy, 
      comparative safety/tolerability, treatment intent, comparative treatment cost, 
      comparative other medical costs, and quality of evidence. Framework validation in 
      2 drug cases resulted in similar value scores, although they were based on 
      different contributing criteria and resulted in different clinical 
      recommendations. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a reflective MCDA 
      framework for the assessment and positioning of oncologic therapies in Spain. 
      Additional work is needed to create a manual for practical decision making in the 
      clinical setting.

TI  - Stakeholder perception of pharmaceutical value: A multicriteria decision analysis 
      pilot case study for value assessment in the United States.
PG  - 1190-1196

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent attention to value frameworks has highlighted limitations of 
      current conventional value and health technology assessment (V/HTA) methods (eg, 
      cost-effectiveness). Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has potential as a 
      supplemental tool to incorporate additional value criteria into conventional 
      value assessment. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot study to illustrate the impact of 
      an MCDA approach on the value perceptions of hypothetical treatment profiles from 
      a multistakeholder panel. METHODS: Participants voted on value perceptions of 2 
      hypothetical treatments with similar cost-effectiveness evidence: Treatment A for 
      aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults and treatment B for episodic 
      migraine in adults. Participants voted treatments A and B as low, intermediate, 
      or high value before and after a weighting exercise on prespecified, additional 
      value criteria. Weights from participants were used to calculate 
      treatment-specific MCDA scores from 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) 
      and were presented to participants for a second value-perception vote. Analyses 
      compared changes in value perceptions within treatments A and B post-MCDA 
      exercise. RESULTS: Before considering MCDA scores for treatment A, 0% of 
      participants considered it to be low, 52% intermediate, and 48% high value. After 
      considering MCDA scores for treatment A, 4% considered it low, 29% intermediate, 
      and 67% high value. Both before and after considering MCDA scores for treatment 
      B, 13%, considered it low, 57% intermediate, and 30% high value. Mean MCDA scores 
      for treatments A and B were 67 and 63, respectively. Of all stakeholders, 41% 
      altered their perception of value for treatment A (9% negatively and 32% 
      positively) and, separately, 45% for treatment B (23% both negatively and 
      positively) after considering MCDA scores. CONCLUSIONS: With nearly half of 
      participants altering their perception of value after consideration of additional 
      value criteria, findings support the need for a more inclusive and flexible value 
      assessment process. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by The National 
      Pharmaceutical Council. Dr Perfetto was employed by the National Health Council

AB  - The study presents the possibility of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      application when choosing analytical procedures with low environmental impact. A 
      type of MCDA, Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations 
      (PROMETHEE), was chosen as versatile tool that meets all the analytical 
      chemists--decision makers requirements. Twenty five analytical procedures for 
      aldrin determination in water samples (as an example) were selected as input 
      alternatives to MCDA analysis. Nine different criteria describing the 
      alternatives were chosen from different groups--metrological, economical and the 
      most importantly--environmental impact. The weights for each criterion were 
      obtained from questionnaires that were sent to experts, giving three different 
      scenarios for MCDA results. The results of analysis show that PROMETHEE is very 
      promising tool to choose the analytical procedure with respect to its greenness. 
      The rankings for all three scenarios placed solid phase microextraction and 
      liquid phase microextraction--based procedures high, while liquid-liquid 
      extraction, solid phase extraction and stir bar sorptive extraction--based 
      procedures were placed low in the ranking. The results show that although some of 
      the experts do not intentionally choose green analytical chemistry procedures, 
      their MCDA choice is in accordance with green chemistry principles. The PROMETHEE 
      ranking results were compared with more widely accepted green analytical 
      chemistry tools--NEMI and Eco-Scale. As PROMETHEE involved more different factors 
      than NEMI, the assessment results were only weakly correlated. Oppositely, the 
      results of Eco-Scale assessment were well-correlated as both methodologies 
      involved similar criteria of assessment.

TI  - Can Streamlined Multicriteria Decision Analysis Be Used to Implement Shared 
      Decision Making for Colorectal Cancer Screening?
PG  - 746-55
LID - 10.1177/0272989X13513338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current US colorectal cancer screening guidelines that call for 
      shared decision making regarding the choice among several recommended screening 
      options are difficult to implement. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an 
      established method well suited for supporting shared decision making. Our study 
      goal was to determine whether a streamlined form of MCDA using rank-order-based 
      judgments can accurately assess patients' colorectal cancer screening priorities. 
      METHODS: We converted priorities for 4 decision criteria and 3 subcriteria 
      regarding colorectal cancer screening obtained from 484 average-risk patients 
      using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a prior study into rank-order-based 
      priorities using rank order centroids. We compared the 2 sets of priorities using 
      Spearman rank correlation and nonparametric Bland-Altman limits of agreement 
      analysis. We assessed the differential impact of using the rank-order-based 
      versus the AHP-based priorities on the results of a full MCDA comparing 3 
      currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Generalizability of 
      the results was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Correlations 
      between the 2 sets of priorities for the 7 criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. The 
      proportions of differences between rank-order-based and AHP-based priorities that 
      were more than ±0.15 ranged from 1% to 16%. Differences in the full MCDA results 
      were minimal, and the relative rankings of the 3 screening options were identical 
      more than 88% of the time. The Monte Carlo simulation results were similar. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Rank-order-based MCDA could be a simple, practical way to guide 
      individual decisions and assess population decision priorities regarding 
      colorectal cancer screening strategies. Additional research is warranted to 
      further explore the use of these methods for promoting shared decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc) are being 
      developed. The objectives were to develop an instrument for collating case data 
      and evaluate its sensibility; use forced-choice methods to reduce and weight 
      criteria; and explore agreement among experts on the probability that cases were 
      classified as SSc. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A standardized instrument was tested 
      for sensibility. The instrument was applied to 20 cases covering a range of 
      probabilities that each had SSc. Experts rank ordered cases from highest to 
      lowest probability; reduced and weighted the criteria using forced-choice 
      methods; and reranked the cases. Consistency in rankings was evaluated using 
      intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Experts endorsed clarity 
      (83%), comprehensibility (100%), face and content validity (100%). Criteria were 
      weighted (points): finger skin thickening (14-22), fingertip lesions (9-21), 
      friction rubs (21), finger flexion contractures (16), pulmonary fibrosis (14), 
      SSc-related antibodies (15), Raynaud phenomenon (13), calcinosis (12), pulmonary 
      hypertension (11), renal crisis (11), telangiectasia (10), abnormal nailfold 
      capillaries (10), esophageal dilation (7), and puffy fingers (5). The ICC across 
      experts was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58, 0.86] and improved to 0.80 
      (95% CI: 0.68, 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Using a sensible instrument and forced-choice 
      methods, the number of criteria were reduced by 39% (range, 23-14) and weighted. 
      Our methods reflect the rigors of measurement science and serve as a template for 
      developing classification criteria.

AB  - Conservation conflicts are increasing on a global scale and instruments for 
      reconciling competing interests are urgently needed. Multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) is a structured, decision-support process that can facilitate 
      dialogue between groups with differing interests and incorporate human and 
      environmental dimensions of conflict. MCDA is a structured and transparent method 
      of breaking down complex problems and incorporating multiple objectives. The 
      value of this process for addressing major challenges in conservation conflict 
      management is that MCDA helps in setting realistic goals; entails a transparent 
      decision-making process; and addresses mistrust, differing world views, 
      cross-scale issues, patchy or contested information, and inflexible legislative 
      tools. Overall we believe MCDA provides a valuable decision-support tool, 
      particularly for increasing awareness of the effects of particular values and 
      choices for working toward negotiated compromise, although an awareness of the 
      effect of methodological choices and the limitations of the method is vital 
      before applying it in conflict situations.

      quasi-experimental evaluation using multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - e054672

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the person-centred, integrated care programme 
      Care Chain Frail Elderly (CCFE) compared with usual care, using multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA). DESIGN: In a 12-month quasi-experimental study, 
      triple-aim outcomes were measured at 0, 6 and 12 months by trained interviewers 
      during home-visits. SETTING: Primary care, community-based elderly care. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 384 community-dwelling frail elderly were enrolled. The 12-month 
      completion rate was 70% in both groups. Propensity score matching was used to 
      balance age, gender, marital status, living situation, education, smoking status 
      and 3 month costs prior to baseline between the two groups. INTERVENTION: The 
      CCFE is an integrated care programme with unique features like the presence of 
      the elderly and informal caregiver at the multidisciplinary team meetings, and a 
      bundled payment. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The MCDA results in 
      weighted overall value scores that combines the performance on physical 
      functioning, psychological well-being, social relationships and participation, 
      enjoyment of life, resilience, person-centredness, continuity of care and costs, 
      with importance weights of patients, informal caregivers, professionals, payers 
      and policy-makers. RESULTS: At 6 months, the overall value scores of CCFE were 
      higher in all stakeholder groups, driven by enjoyment of life (standardised 
      performance scores 0.729 vs 0.685) and person-centredness (0.749 vs 0.663). At 12 
      months, the overall value scores in both groups were similar from a patient's 
      perspective, slightly higher for CCFE from an informal caregiver's and 
      professional's perspective, and lower for CCFE from a payer's and policy-maker's 
      perspective. The latter was driven by a worse performance on physical functioning 
      (0.682 vs 0.731) and higher costs (€22 816 vs €20 680). CONCLUSIONS: The MCDA 
      indicated that the CCFE is the preferred way of delivering care to frail elderly 
      at 6 months. However, at 12 months, MCDA results showed little difference from 
      the perspective of patients, informal caregivers and professionals, while payers 
      and policy-makers seemed to prefer usual care.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis framework for developing and evaluating coastal 
      retreat policy.
PG  - 83-98
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4662 [doi]
AB  - Managed retreat may be a necessity for coastal communities as sea levels rise due 
      to climate change. Selecting the right policy decisions and timing is difficult 
      given the vested interests of communities and stakeholder groups and requires 
      careful balancing of the benefits and risks associated with each management 
      alternative. State and federal agencies often employ single-objective 
      optimization frameworks such as cost-benefit analysis to analyze coastal 
      relocation alternatives, but such methods are limited in their ability to balance 
      competing value considerations and stakeholder demands. The use of a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology allows for such considerations 
      to be quantified and evaluated, thereby improving planning and decision-making 
      for coastal retreat policies. This paper provides a strategic MCDA framework to 
      evaluate coastal retreat policy that could be leveraged by at-risk coastal 
      communities. The MCDA is applied to a hypothetical coastal retreat scenario to 
      visualize policy preferences and differing value considerations among 
      stakeholders. This model can be used by government agencies to foster more sound, 
      acceptable, and implementable coastal retreat policies and streamline the 
      incorporation of this climate adaptation mechanism, which may be necessary for 
      the near future. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2023;19:83-98. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Using multicriteria decision analysis during drug development to predict 
      reimbursement decisions.
PG  - 25270
LID - 10.3402/jmahp.v2.25270 [doi]
LID - 25270
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical companies design clinical development programs to 
      generate the data that they believe will support reimbursement for the 
      experimental compound. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to present a 
      process for using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) by a pharmaceutical 
      company to estimate the probability of a positive recommendation for 
      reimbursement for a new drug given drug and environmental attributes. METHODS: 
      The MCDA process included 1) selection of decisions makers who were 
      representative of those making reimbursement decisions in a specific country; 2) 
      two pre-workshop questionnaires to identify the most important attributes and 
      their relative importance for a positive recommendation for a new drug; 3) a 
      1-day workshop during which participants undertook three tasks: i) they agreed on 
      a final list of decision attributes and their importance weights, ii) they 
      developed level descriptions for these attributes and mapped each attribute level 
      to a value function, and iii) they developed profiles for hypothetical products 
      'just likely to be reimbursed'; and 4) use of the data from the workshop to 
      develop a prediction algorithm based on a logistic regression analysis. The MCDA 
      process is illustrated using case studies for three countries, the United 
      Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The extent to which the prediction algorithms for 
      each country captured the decision processes for the workshop participants in our 
      case studies was tested using a post-meeting questionnaire that asked the 
      participants to make recommendations for a set of hypothetical products. RESULTS: 
      The data collected in the case study workshops resulted in a prediction 
      algorithm: 1) for the United Kingdom, the probability of a positive 
      recommendation for different ranges of cost-effectiveness ratios; 2) for Spain, 
      the probability of a positive recommendation at the national and regional levels; 
      and 3) for Germany, the probability of a determination of clinical benefit. The 
      results from the post-meeting questionnaire revealed a high predictive value for 
      the algorithm developed using MCDA. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction algorithms developed 
      using MCDA could be used by pharmaceutical companies when designing their 
      clinical development programs to estimate the likelihood of a favourable 
      reimbursement recommendation for different product profiles and for different 
      positions in the treatment pathway.

TI  - Applying Reflective Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to Patient-Clinician 
      Shared Decision-Making on the Management of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine 
      Tumors (GEP-NET) in the Spanish Context.
PG  - 1215-1231
LID - 10.1007/s12325-018-0745-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unresectable, well-differentiated nonfunctioning 
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) can be monitored 
      (watchful waiting, WW) or treated with systemic therapy such as somatostatin 
      analogues (SSAs) to delay progression. We applied a reflective multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) shared-decision framework (previously developed for the 
      USA) to explore what matters to Spanish patients and clinicians considering 
      GEP-NET treatment options. METHODS: The EVIDEM-derived framework was updated and 
      adapted to the Spanish context. During a Chatham House session, five patients and 
      six physicians assigned criteria weights using hierarchical point allocation and 
      direct rating scale (alternative analysis). Informed by synthesized evidence 
      embedded in the framework, participants scored how each criterion favored SSA 
      treatment (reference case lanreotide) or WW and shared insights and knowledge. 
      Weights and scores were combined into value contributions (norm. 
      weight × score/5), which were added across criteria to derive the relative 
      benefit-risk balance (RBRB, scale - 1 to + 1). Exploratory comparisons to US 
      study findings were performed. RESULTS: Focusing on intervention outcomes 
      (effectiveness, patient-reported, and safety), the mean RBRB favored treatment 
      over WW (+ 0.32 ± 0.24), with the largest contributions from progression-free 
      survival (+ 0.11 ± SD 0.07), fatal adverse events (+ 0.06 ± SD 0.08), and impact 
      on HRQoL (+ 0.04 ± SD 0.04). Consideration of modulating criteria (type of 
      benefit, need, costs, evidence, and feasibility) increased the RBRB to 
      + 0.50 ± 0.14, with type of therapeutic benefit (+ 0.10 ± SD 0.08) and quality of 
      evidence (+ 0.08 ± SD 0.06) contributing most towards treatment. Alternative 
      weighting yielded similar results. Results were broadly comparable to those 
      derived from the US study. CONCLUSION: The multicriteria framework helped Spanish 
      patients and clinicians identify and express what matters to them. The approach 
      is transferable across decision-making contexts. FUNDING: IPSEN Pharma.

      judgement in a benefit-risk assessment of six well-known pain-relief drugs. 
      METHODS: Six over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics were evaluated against three 
      favourable effects and eight unfavourable effects by seven experts who specialise 
      in the relief of pain, two in a 2-day facilitated workshop whose input data and 
      judgements were later peer-reviewed by five additional experts. KEY FINDINGS: 
      Ibuprofen salts and solubilised emerged with the best benefit-risk profile, 
      followed by naproxen, ibuprofen acid, diclofenac, paracetamol and aspirin. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Multicriteria decision analysis enabled participants to evaluate the 
      OTC analgesics against a range of favourable and unfavourable effects in a group 
      setting that enabled all issues to be openly aired and debated. The model was 
      easily communicated and understood by the peer reviewers, so the model should be 
      comprehensible to physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to establish the most relevant health outcomes 
      to assess opioid substitution treatment programmes (OSP) in patients with opioid 
      use disorder (OUD) in Spain. A multicriteria decision analysis was applied in 3 
      phases: 1) concepts and criteria definitions; 2) criteria screening and weighting 
      by means of a discrete choice experiment; 3) deliberative process. Criteria 
      established in phase 1 were: substance use (opioids, alcohol, tobacco, stimulants 
      and cannabis), other mental disorders (affective/anxiety disorder, psychosis, 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, 
      antisocial personality disorder, gambling disorder and other impulse control 
      disorders), level of disability, adherence, medical illnesses (medical 
      comorbidities, risk behaviours, infectious and sexually transmitted diseases), 
      psychosocial aspects (hostile and/or violent behaviour and work problems), 
      functional disability (quality of life, treatment and service satisfaction, 
      social functionality). In phase 2, the most relevant factors in OSP were 
      determined, and subsequently assessed in the deliberative process: remission of 
      substance use (opioids, alcohol and stimulants), improvement of other mental 
      disorders (psychosis and borderline personality disorder), improvement in 
      comorbidity management, and improvement in social functionality, with a weighting 
      of 56.5%, 21.9%, 11.0%, and 10.7%, respectively. The current analysis defines the 
      main health outcomes in OSP in patients with OUD in Spain, supporting decision 
      making and socio-health management of existing resources.

AB  - Wild pigs are a widespread invasive species that pose significant environmental 
      and social risks. A number of wild pig eradication and control measures exist, 
      but many eradication campaigns are ultimately unsuccessful. Decision making 
      regarding how to design and execute an eradication plan is difficult because of 
      multiple costs and benefits spanning various decision criteria that are 
      associated with different eradication and control countermeasures. Moreover, 
      multiple stakeholders are often involved with differing and sometimes competing 
      objectives, and wild pigs are adaptive adversaries, meaning that the ideal 
      countermeasure may change over time. In this paper, we propose the use of formal 
      decision analytic tools which can structure decision problems into a set of 
      relevant criteria, countermeasures, and stakeholder preferences to facilitate the 
      evaluation of tradeoffs. We operationalize this method in a simple Excel-based 
      decision tool and conclude with a path forward regarding how to successfully 
      implement such tools for effective wild pig control.

TI  - A multicriteria decision analysis model and risk assessment framework for carbon 
      capture and storage.
PG  - 1720-37
LID - 10.1111/risa.12211 [doi]
AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied to various energy 
      problems to incorporate a variety of qualitative and quantitative criteria, 
      usually spanning environmental, social, engineering, and economic fields. MCDA 
      and associated methods such as life-cycle assessments and cost-benefit analysis 
      can also include risk analysis to address uncertainties in criteria estimates. 
      One technology now being assessed to help mitigate climate change is carbon 
      capture and storage (CCS). CCS is a new process that captures CO2 emissions from 
      fossil-fueled power plants and injects them into geological reservoirs for 
      storage. It presents a unique challenge to decisionmakers (DMs) due to its 
      technical complexity, range of environmental, social, and economic impacts, 
      variety of stakeholders, and long time spans. The authors have developed a risk 
      assessment model using a MCDA approach for CCS decisions such as selecting 
      between CO2 storage locations and choosing among different mitigation actions for 
      reducing risks. The model includes uncertainty measures for several factors, 
      utility curve representations of all variables, Monte Carlo simulation, and 
      sensitivity analysis. This article uses a CCS scenario example to demonstrate the 
      development and application of the model based on data derived from published 
      articles and publicly available sources. The model allows high-level DMs to 
      better understand project risks and the tradeoffs inherent in modern, complex 
      energy decisions.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis for monitoring ecosystem service function of the 
      Three-River Headwaters region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.
PG  - 355
LID - 10.1007/s10661-015-4523-5 [doi]
AB  - The Three-River Headwaters (TRH) region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, is 
      of key importance to the ecological security of China and Southeast Asia and 
      contains some of the most sensitive and fragile ecosystems. Monitoring and 
      evaluating the ecosystem service function and its changes in the TRH region could 
      support decision-making for regional ecological protection and restoration 
      programs. Referencing the concept of ecosystem service and the Millennium 
      Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework, this study built a system of indicators for 
      monitoring and evaluating the ecosystem service function. Thus, combining a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and weighted linear combination (WLC) with 
      analytic hierarchy process (AHP), we applied the ecosystem service function index 
      (ESFI) based on remote sensing data at 1-km spatial resolution to 
      spatiotemporally monitor the changes during the period 2005-2010. The study 
      results indicated that ESFI had a good performance for monitoring the ecosystem 
      service function and showed an improving trend in the TRH region over the past 5 
      years. Ecosystem environment recovery not only reflected the changing trend of 
      warm and wet climate but was also a response of the ecological protection project 
      of the Key Ecological Function Zone in the TRH region.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis: a comprehensive decision approach for management 
      of contaminated sediments.
PG  - 61-78
AB  - Contaminated sediments and other sites present a difficult challenge for 
      environmental decisionmakers. They are typically slow to recover or attenuate 
      naturally, may involve multiple regulatory agencies and stakeholder groups, and 
      engender multiple toxicological and ecotoxicological risks. While environmental 
      decision-making strategies over the last several decades have evolved into 
      increasingly more sophisticated, information-intensive, and complex approaches, 
      there remains considerable dissatisfaction among business, industry, and the 
      public with existing management strategies. Consequently, contaminated sediments 
      and materials are the subject of intense technology development, such as 
      beneficial reuse or in situ treatment. However, current decision analysis 
      approaches, such as comparative risk assessment, benefit-cost analysis, and life 
      cycle assessment, do not offer a comprehensive approach for incorporating the 
      varied types of information and multiple stakeholder and public views that must 
      typically be brought to bear when new technologies are under consideration. 
      Alternatively, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a scientifically 
      sound decision framework for management of contaminated materials or sites where 
      stakeholder participation is of crucial concern and criteria such as economics, 
      environmental impacts, safety, and risk cannot be easily condensed into simple 
      monetary expressions. This article brings together a multidisciplinary review of 
      existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States 
      and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in MCDA methods applicable 
      to the assessment of contaminated sediment management technologies. Additionally, 
      it tests an MCDA approach for coupling expert judgment and stakeholder values in 
      a hypothetical contaminated sediments management case study wherein MCDA is used 
      as a tool for testing stakeholder responses to and improving expert assessment of 
      innovative contaminated sediments technologies.

AB  - The third section of our Special Task Force report identifies and defines a 
      series of elements that warrant consideration in value assessments of medical 
      technologies. We aim to broaden the view of what constitutes value in health care 
      and to spur new research on incorporating additional elements of value into 
      cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Twelve potential elements of value are 
      considered. Four of them-quality-adjusted life-years, net costs, productivity, 
      and adherence-improving factors-are conventionally included or considered in 
      value assessments. Eight others, which would be more novel in economic 
      assessments, are defined and discussed: reduction in uncertainty, fear of 
      contagion, insurance value, severity of disease, value of hope, real option 
      value, equity, and scientific spillovers. Most of these are theoretically well 
      understood and available for inclusion in value assessments. The two exceptions 
      are equity and scientific spillover effects, which require more theoretical 
      development and consensus. A number of regulatory authorities around the globe 
      have shown interest in some of these novel elements. Augmenting CEA to consider 
      these additional elements would result in a more comprehensive CEA in line with 
      the "impact inventory" of the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and 
      Medicine. Possible approaches for valuation and inclusion of these elements 
      include integrating them as part of a net monetary benefit calculation, including 
      elements as attributes in health state descriptions, or using them as criteria in 
      a multicriteria decision analysis. Further research is needed on how best to 
      measure and include them in decision making.

AB  - Due to various desirable physicochemical properties, ionic liquids (ILs) are 
      still gaining in popularity. ILs have been recurrently considered green solvents. 
      However, environmental, health and safety assessments of ILs have raised certain 
      doubts about their benignness, and their greenness status is currently unclear. 
      To clarify the situation on their greenness, we perform a comprehensive 
      assessment of more than 300 commercially available ILs. We apply multicriteria 
      decision analysis, the tool that allows ranking many alternatives according to 
      relevant criteria. They are toxicity towards various organisms, biodegradability, 
      hazard statements and precautionary measures during their handling. We 
      incorporated organic solvents to rankings, as their greenness is better 
      described, so they serve as greenness reference points. The ranking results 
      obtained considering the whole set of criteria show that ILs are placed between 
      recommended polar solvents and problematic/undesirable non polar organic solvents 
      in terms of greenness. However, the exclusion of toxicity data due to 
      unavailability of endpoints results in assessment of ILs as greener than most of 
      organic solvents.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health administration is complex and serves many masters. Value, 
      quality, infrastructure and reimbursement are just a sample of the competing 
      interests influencing executive decision-making. This creates a need for decision 
      processes that are rational and holistic. METHODS: We created a multicriteria 
      decision analysis tool to evaluate six fields of healthcare provision: return on 
      investment, capacity, outcomes, safety, training and risk. The tool was designed 
      for prospective use, at the beginning of each funding round for competing 
      projects. Administrators were asked to rank their criteria in order of 
      preference. Each field was assigned a representative weight determined from the 
      rankings. Project data were then entered into the tool for each of the six 
      fields. The score for each field was scaled as a proportion of the highest 
      scoring project, then weighted by preference. We then plotted findings on a 
      cost-effectiveness plane. The project was piloted and developed over successive 
      uses by the hospital's executive board. RESULTS: Twelve projects competing for 
      funding at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were scored by the tool. It 
      created a priority ranking for each initiative based on the weights assigned to 
      each field by the executive board. Projects were plotted on a cost-effectiveness 
      plane with score as the x-axis and cost of implementation as the y-axis. Projects 
      to the bottom right were considered dominant over projects above and to the left, 
      indicating that they provided greater benefit at a lower cost. Projects below the 
      x-axis were cost-saving and recommended provided they did not harm patients. All 
      remaining projects above the x-axis were then recommended in order of lowest to 
      highest cost-per-point scored. CONCLUSION: This tool provides a transparent, 
      objective method of decision analysis using accessible software. It would serve 
      health services delivery organisations that seek to achieve value in healthcare.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis for including health interventions in the 
      universal health coverage benefit package in Thailand.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Considering rising health expenditure on the one hand and increasing 
      public expectations on the other hand, there is a need for explicit health care 
      rationing to secure public acceptance of coverage decisions of health 
      interventions. The National Health Security Office, the institute managing the 
      Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand, recently called for more rational, 
      transparent, and fair decisions on the public reimbursement of health 
      interventions. This article describes the application of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) to guide the coverage decisions on including health interventions 
      in the Universal Coverage Scheme health benefit package in the period 2009-2010. 
      METHODS: We described the MCDA priority-setting process through participatory 
      observation and evaluated the rational, transparency, and fairness of the 
      priority-setting process against the accountability for reasonableness framework. 
      RESULTS: The MCDA was applied in four steps: 1) 17 interventions were nominated 
      for assessment; 2) nine interventions were selected for further quantitative 
      assessment on the basis of the following criteria: size of population affected by 
      disease, severity of disease, effectiveness of health intervention, variation in 
      practice, economic impact on household expenditure, and equity and social 
      implications; 3) these interventions were then assessed in terms of 
      cost-effectiveness and budget impact; and 4) decision makers qualitatively 
      appraised, deliberated, and reached consensus on which interventions should be 
      adopted in the package. CONCLUSION: This project was carried out in a real-world 
      context and has considerably contributed to the rational, transparent, and fair 
      priority-setting process through the application of MCDA. Although the present 
      project has applied MCDA in the Thai context, MCDA is adaptable to other 
      settings.

TI  - A simple way to unify multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and stochastic 
      multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) using a Dirichlet distribution in 
      benefit-risk assessment.
PG  - 567-578
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201600113 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative methodologies have been proposed to support decision making in drug 
      development and monitoring. In particular, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) are useful tools to 
      assess the benefit-risk ratio of medicines according to the performances of the 
      treatments on several criteria, accounting for the preferences of the decision 
      makers regarding the relative importance of these criteria. However, even in its 
      probabilistic form, MCDA requires the exact elicitations of the weights of the 
      criteria by the decision makers, which may be difficult to achieve in practice. 
      SMAA allows for more flexibility and can be used with unknown or partially known 
      preferences, but it is less popular due to its increased complexity and the high 
      degree of uncertainty in its results. In this paper, we propose a simple model as 
      a generalization of MCDA and SMAA, by applying a Dirichlet distribution to the 
      weights of the criteria and by making its parameters vary. This unique model 
      permits to fit both MCDA and SMAA, and allows for a more extended exploration of 
      the benefit-risk assessment of treatments. The precision of its results depends 
      on the precision parameter of the Dirichlet distribution, which could be 
      naturally interpreted as the strength of confidence of the decision makers in 
      their elicitation of preferences.

TI  - Prioritization of livestock transboundary diseases in Belgium using a 
      multicriteria decision analysis tool based on drivers of emergence.
PG  - 344-376
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13356 [doi]
AB  - During the past decade, livestock diseases have (re-)emerged in areas where they 
      had been previously eradicated or never been recorded before. Drivers (i.e. 
      factors of (re-)emergence) have been identified. Livestock diseases spread 
      irrespective of borders, and therefore, reliable methods are required to help 
      decision-makers to identify potential threats and try stopping their 
      (re-)emergence. Ranking methods and multicriteria approaches are cost-effective 
      tools for such purpose and were applied to prioritize a list of selected diseases 
      (N = 29 including 6 zoonoses) based on the opinion of 62 experts in accordance 
      with 50 drivers-related criteria. Diseases appearing in the upper ranking were 
      porcine epidemic diarrhoea, foot-and-mouth disease, low pathogenic avian 
      influenza, African horse sickness and highly pathogenic avian influenza. The tool 
      proposed uses a multicriteria decision analysis approach to prioritize pathogens 
      according to drivers and can be applied to other countries or diseases.

TI  - Discrepancies between multicriteria decision analysis-based ranking and intuitive 
      ranking for pharmaceutical benefit-risk profiles in a hypothetical setting.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1111/jcpt.12486 [doi]
AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been 
      generally considered a promising decision-making methodology for the assessment 
      of drug benefit-risk profiles. There have been many discussions in both public 
      and private sectors on its feasibility and applicability, but it has not been 
      employed in official decision-makings. For the purpose of examining to what 
      extent MCDA would reflect the first-hand, intuitive preference of evaluators in 
      practical pharmaceutical assessments, we conducted a questionnaire survey 
      involving the participation of employees of pharmaceutical companies. METHODS: 
      Showing profiles of the efficacy and safety of four hypothetical drugs, each 
      respondent was asked to rank them following the standard MCDA process and then to 
      rank them intuitively (i.e. without applying any analytical framework). RESULTS 
      AND DISCUSSION: These two approaches resulted in substantially different ranking 
      patterns from the same individuals, and the concordance rate was surprisingly low 
      (17%). Although many respondents intuitively showed a preference for mild, 
      balanced risk-benefit profiles over profiles with a conspicuous advantage in 
      either risk or benefit, the ranking orders based on MCDA scores did not reflect 
      the intuitive preference. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Observed discrepancies 
      between the rankings seemed to be primarily attributed to the structural 
      characteristics of MCDA, which assumes that evaluation on each benefit and risk 
      component should have monotonic impact on final scores. It would be difficult for 
      MCDA to reflect commonly observed non-monotonic preferences for risk and benefit 
      profiles. Possible drawbacks of MCDA should be further investigated prior to the 
      real-world application of its benefit-risk assessment.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis to assess options for managing contaminated 
      sediments: Application to Southern Busan Harbor, South Korea.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1897/IEAM_2009-032.1 [doi]
AB  - Many years of untreated effluent discharge from residential areas, a shipyard, a 
      marina, and a large fish market resulted in substantial contamination of bottom 
      sediment in Southern Busan Harbor, South Korea. Contaminants in these sediments 
      include heavy metals and organic compounds. Newly introduced regulations for 
      ocean disposal of dredged material in South Korea pose significant challenges, 
      because the previous practice of offshore disposal of contaminated dredged 
      material was no longer possible after August 2008. The South Korean government 
      has mandated that such sediments be assessed in a way that identifies the most 
      appropriate dredged material management alternative, addressing environmental, 
      social, and cost objectives. An approach using multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) in combination with comparative risk assessment was used as a systematic 
      and transparent framework for prioritizing several dredged sediment management 
      alternatives. We illustrate how MCDA can recognize the multiple goals of 
      contaminated sediment management. Values used in weighting decision criteria were 
      derived from surveys of stakeholders who were sediment management professionals, 
      business owners, or government decision makers. The results of the analysis 
      showed that land reclamation was the preferred alternative among cement-lock, 
      sediment washing, 3 contained aquatic disposal alternatives (one in combination 
      with a hopper dredge), geotextile tubes, solidification, and land reclamation 
      after solidification treatment. Land reclamation was the preferred alternative, 
      which performed well across all MCDA objectives, because of the availability of a 
      near-shore confined disposal facility within a reasonable distance from the 
      dredging area.

TI  - Treatment Preference for Alzheimer's Disease: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis 
      with Caregivers, Neurologists, and Payors.
PG  - 211-227
LID - 10.1007/s40120-022-00423-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with a high burden of illness. New therapies under development include 
      agents that target amyloid-beta (Aβ), a key component in AD pathogenesis. 
      Understanding the decision-making process for new AD drugs would help determine 
      if such therapies should be adopted by society. Multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) was applied to three key stakeholder groups to assess treatment 
      alternatives for AD based on a multitude of decision trade-offs covering main 
      components of care. METHODS: AD caregivers (n = 117), neurologists (n = 90), and 
      payors (n = 90) from the USA received an online survey. The decision problem was 
      broken down into four decision criterion and 12 subcriteria for two treatment 
      scenarios: an Aβ-targeted therapy vs. the standard of care (SOC). Respondents 
      were asked to indicate how much they preferred one option over another on a scale 
      from 1 (equal preference) to 9 (high preference) based on each criterion and 
      subcriterion. The decision criteria and subcriteria were weighted and presented 
      as partial utility scores (pUS), with higher scores suggesting an increased 
      preference for that decision-making component. RESULTS: Caregivers and payors 
      applied the highest value to need for intervention (mean pUS = 0.303 and 0.259) 
      and clinical outcomes (mean pUS = 0.286 and 0.377). In contrast, neurologists 
      placed the highest value on clinical outcomes and types of benefits (mean 
      pUS = 0.436 and 0.248). When decision subcriteria were examined, efficacy (mean 
      pUS = 0.115, 0.219, and 0.166) and the type of patient benefits (mean 
      pUS = 0.135, 0.178, and 0.126) were among the most valued by caregivers, 
      neurologists, and payors. CONCLUSION: All groups placed the highest value on drug 
      efficacy and types of benefit derived by patients. In contrast, cost implications 
      were among the least important aspects in their decision-making.

AB  - A novel and efficient approach to optimization of extraction step prior the 
      chromatographic determination of nine chlorinated phenols is described. It is 
      based on the combination of design of experiments and multicriteria decision 
      analysis. Such an approach is used to optimize dispersive liquid-liquid 
      microextraction procedure for the determination of 9 chlorophenols in water 
      samples. Three parameters are optimized - sample volume, volume of disperser 
      solvent and extraction solvent. Combination of the technique for order of 
      preference by similarity to ideal solution with central composite design allows 
      to perform multi-analyte procedure optimization. It gives information about the 
      efficiency of the system for every experimental plan point in terms of closeness 
      to ideal solution. The optimal conditions for extraction of chlorophenols are 
      76 μL of extraction solvent, 0.6 mL of dispersive solvent and 6.7 mL of water 
      sample. The presented approach has the potential to be applied in variety of 
      optimization systems.

TI  - Applying a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Approach to Elicit 
      Stakeholders' Preferences in Italy: The Case of Obinutuzumab for 
      Rituximab-Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL).
PG  - 153-163
LID - 10.1007/s41669-017-0048-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare decision makers need to make trade-offs between different 
      elements of value of new treatments. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      provides a framework that can help decision makers to understand stakeholders' 
      preferences and be explicit about the trade-offs that are being made. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective of this study was to use MCDA to obtain preferences and views on 
      decision criteria across three stakeholder groups (patients, clinicians and 
      payers) in Italy and to use these to assess the performance of obinutuzumab for 
      rituximab-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). METHODS: We used 
      EVIDEM V3.0, an MCDA framework, and collected participants' preferences via an 
      online survey and structured meetings. RESULTS: Patients and clinicians expressed 
      a preference for interventions targeting severe conditions. Payers expressed 
      preference for treatments targeting areas with an unmet need, which are cheaper 
      than the comparator, and with high-quality evidence. Obinutuzumab in combination 
      with bendamustine, compared with bendamustine alone, received high positive 
      scores for the criteria 'disease severity' and 'type of therapeutic benefit' by 
      all three groups, and negative scores on the economic-related criteria, according 
      to all stakeholder groups. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA can be used to elicit the views of 
      different stakeholder groups and has the potential to structure and inform 
      reimbursement decisions.

      assessment: applying the EVIDEM decision-making framework to growth hormone for 
      Turner syndrome patients.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-8-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test and further develop a healthcare policy and clinical decision 
      support framework using growth hormone (GH) for Turner syndrome (TS) as a complex 
      case study. METHODS: The EVIDEM framework was further developed to complement the 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) Value Matrix, that includes 15 
      quantifiable components of decision clustered in four domains (quality of 
      evidence, disease, intervention and economics), with a qualitative tool including 
      six ethical and health system-related components of decision. An extensive review 
      of the literature was performed to develop a health technology assessment report 
      (HTA) tailored to each component of decision, and content was validated by 
      experts. A panel of representative stakeholders then estimated the MCDA value of 
      GH for TS in Canada by assigning weights and scores to each MCDA component of 
      decision and then considered the impact of non-quantifiable components of 
      decision. RESULTS: Applying the framework revealed significant data gaps and the 
      importance of aligning research questions with data needs to truly inform 
      decision. Panelists estimated the value of GH for TS at 41% of maximum value on 
      the MCDA scale, with good agreement at the individual level (retest value 40%; 
      ICC: 0.687) and large variation across panelists. Main contributors to this panel 
      specific value were "Improvement of efficacy", "Disease severity" and "Quality of 
      evidence". Ethical considerations on utility, efficiency and fairness as well as 
      potential misuse of GH had mixed effects on the perceived value of the treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This framework is proposed as a pragmatic step beyond the current 
      cost-effectiveness model, combining HTA, MCDA, values and ethics. It supports 
      systematic consideration of all components of decision and available evidence for 
      greater transparency. Further testing and validation is needed to build up MCDA 
      approaches combined with pragmatic HTA in healthcare decision-making.

TI  - Prioritizing the Best Potential Regions for Brine Concentration Systems in the 
      USA Using GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c05462 [doi]
AB  - We propose a methodology for identifying and prioritizing the best potential 
      locations for brine concentration facilities in the contiguous United States. The 
      methodology uses a geographic information system and multicriteria decision 
      analysis (GIS-MCDA) to prioritize the potential locations for brine concentration 
      facilities based on thermodynamic, economic, environmental, and social criteria. 
      By integrating geospatial data with a computational simulation of a real brine 
      concentration system, an objective weighting method identifies the weights for 13 
      subcriteria associated with the main criteria. When considering multiple 
      dimensions for decision making, brine concentration facilities centered in 
      Florida were consistently selected as the best location, due to the high 
      second-law efficiency, low transportation cost, and high capacity for supplying 
      municipal water needs to nearby populations. For inland locations, Southeast 
      Texas outperforms all other locations for thermodynamic, economic, and 
      environmental priority cases. A sensitivity analysis evaluates the consistency of 
      the results as the priority of a main criterion varies relative to other 
      decision-making criteria. Focusing on a single subcriterion misleads decision 
      making when identifying the best location for brine concentration systems, 
      identifying the importance of the multicriteria methodology.

TI  - The development and utility of a multicriteria patient decision aid for people 
      contemplating treatment for osteoarthritis.
PG  - 2775-2785
LID - 10.1111/hex.13505 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are a range of treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) of the 
      knee and hip, each with a unique profile of risks and benefits. Patient decision 
      aids can help incorporate patient preferences in treatment decision-making. The 
      aim of this study was to develop and test the utility of a patient decision aid 
      for OA that was developed using a multicriteria decision analytic framework. 
      METHODS: People contemplating treatment for OA who had accessed the website 
      myjointpain.org.au were invited to participate in the study by using the online 
      patient decision aid. Two forms of the patient decision aid were created: A 
      shorter form and a longer form, which allowed greater customization that was 
      offered to respondents after they had completed the shorter form. Respondents 
      also completed questions asking about their experience using the patient decision 
      aid. RESULTS: A total of 625 self-selected respondents completed the short-form 
      and 180 completed the long-form. Across both forms, serious side effects, pain 
      and function were rated as the most important treatment outcomes. Most 
      respondents (64%) who completed the longer form reported that using the tool was 
      a positive experience, 38% reported that using the tool had changed their mind 
      and 48% said that using the tool would improve the quality of their 
      decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings suggest that this patient 
      decision aid may be of use to a substantial number of people in facilitating 
      appropriate treatment decision-making. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Service 
      users of myjointpain.org.au were involved through their participation in the 
      study, and their feedback will guide the development of future iterations of the 
      tool.

AB  - Translational research is conducted to achieve a predefined set of economic or 
      societal goals. As a result, investment decisions on where available resources 
      have the highest potential in achieving these goals have to be made. In this 
      paper, we first describe how multicriteria decision analysis can assist in 
      defining the decision context and in ensuring that all relevant aspects of the 
      decision problem are incorporated in the decision making process. We then present 
      the results of a case study to support priority setting in a translational 
      research consortium aimed at reducing the burden of disease of type 2 diabetes. 
      During problem structuring, we identified four research alternatives (primary, 
      secondary, tertiary microvascular, and tertiary macrovascular prevention) and a 
      set of six decision criteria. Scoring of these alternatives against the criteria 
      was done using a combination of expert judgement and previously published data. 
      Lastly, decision analysis was performed using stochastic multicriteria 
      acceptability analysis, which allows for the combined use of numerical and 
      ordinal data. We found that the development of novel techniques applied in 
      secondary prevention would be a poor investment of research funds. The ranking of 
      the remaining alternatives was however strongly dependent on the decision maker's 
      preferences for certain criteria.

TI  - How decision analysis can further nanoinformatics.
PG  - 1594-600
LID - 10.3762/bjnano.6.162 [doi]
AB  - The increase in nanomaterial research has resulted in increased nanomaterial 
      data. The next challenge is to meaningfully integrate and interpret these data 
      for better and more efficient decisions. Due to the complex nature of 
      nanomaterials, rapid changes in technology, and disunified testing and data 
      publishing strategies, information regarding material properties is often 
      illusive, uncertain, and/or of varying quality, which limits the ability of 
      researchers and regulatory agencies to process and use the data. The vision of 
      nanoinformatics is to address this problem by identifying the information 
      necessary to support specific decisions (a top-down approach) and collecting and 
      visualizing these relevant data (a bottom-up approach). Current nanoinformatics 
      efforts, however, have yet to efficiently focus data acquisition efforts on the 
      research most relevant for bridging specific nanomaterial data gaps. Collecting 
      unnecessary data and visualizing irrelevant information are expensive activities 
      that overwhelm decision makers. We propose that the decision analytic techniques 
      of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), value of information (VOI), weight of 
      evidence (WOE), and portfolio decision analysis (PDA) can bridge the gap from 
      current data collection and visualization efforts to present information relevant 
      to specific decision needs. Decision analytic and Bayesian models could be a 
      natural extension of mechanistic and statistical models for nanoinformatics 
      practitioners to master in solving complex nanotechnology challenges.

TI  - Pragmatic Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Combined With Advanced 
      Pharmacoepidemiology for Benefit-Risk Assessments of Medicines Adapted to the 
      Real-Life Constraints of Regulators: Development and Case Study.
PG  - 620-631
LID - 10.1177/2168479016642812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) represents a promising method 
      for benefit-risk assessment. Our goal was to develop features of pragmatic MCDA 
      (EVIDEM [Evidence and Value: Impact on DEcisionMaking]) addressing real-life 
      regulatory decision-making needs, incorporate advanced pharmacoepidemiology, and 
      test the resulting benefit-risk framework using a case study. METHODS: The 
      Intervention Outcomes domain of EVIDEM was transformed into a generic 
      benefit-risk framework including clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, 
      and adverse event (AE) criteria. The concept of relative benefit-risk balance 
      (RBRB) was developed for comparability across products and therapeutic areas and 
      over time. Evidence matrix was designed to include most relevant data from 
      trials, observational studies, and models, including Bayesian and longitudinal 
      modeling. The framework was tested with a panel of stakeholders using efalizumab 
      for psoriasis as retrospective case study. Uncertainty was explored. RESULTS: The 
      MCDA benefit-risk tree was adapted with psoriasis-specific subcriteria. Panelists 
      assigned similar weights to benefits (0.48; SD, 0.20-0.70) and risks (0.52; SD, 
      0.10-0.60), with large variations reflecting diverse perspectives. Panelist 
      scores reflected higher efficacy versus placebo, lower efficacy versus active 
      comparators, and serious and fatal AEs identified postlicensing. Efalizumab's 
      RBRB was positive at licensing in 2004 (0.29, scale -1 to +1) and ranged from 
      -0.41 (vs active comparators) to 0.01 (vs placebo) in 2009, when its market 
      authorization was withdrawn. Retesting indicated good reproducibility. Panelists 
      acknowledged good face validity and the importance of criteria beyond 
      benefit-risk in real-life assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The approach allows 
      quantification and visualization of benefit-risk over time and across 
      comparators. Combination of pragmatic MCDA designed to integrate criteria beyond 
      benefit-risk and advanced statistics supports application of MCDA to further 
      accountable benefit-risk assessments for real-life decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To pilot the use of multicriteria decision analysis to establish and 
      apply a framework of weighted attributes to value orphan medicinal products. 
      METHODS: Literature searches on the natural history and burden of 40 rare 
      diseases and of how payers assess treatment value and three workshops with, 
      respectively, GlaxoSmithKline managers working on orphan medicinal products, 
      European Union clinical and health economics experts, and representatives of rare 
      diseases patient groups in the European Union. RESULTS: Eight nonmonetary 
      attributes were identified and weights agreed: four concern the disease being 
      treated and four the treatment itself. About half of the weight went to 
      attributes of the disease treated and half to attributes of the treatment. 
      Patient group representatives gave greater weight than did the experts to 
      patients' and carers' quality of daily life. CONCLUSIONS: The multicriteria 
      decision analysis approach piloted works and could be developed for use by payers 
      and health technology assessment bodies.

TI  - Assessing the sustainability of advanced materials using multicriteria decision 
      analysis and the triple bottom line.
PG  - 1021-1028
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4205 [doi]
AB  - Although advanced materials (AdMs) are beneficial in many applications, questions 
      remain as to whether they are more or less sustainable than the conventional 
      materials that they may replace. Currently, there is no available tool to provide 
      clarity to these questions. Traditional approaches for evaluating the 
      sustainability of a chemical or material are usually not standardized, and as a 
      result, the metrics used in sustainability measurements are subjective and often 
      vary from assessor to assessor. Additionally, sustainability characterizations 
      resulting from these approaches are typically presented qualitatively and are 
      often vaguely drawn, making it difficult to confidently and transparently 
      conclude that 1 material is more sustainable than another. This paper aims to 
      address these gaps by enabling stakeholders involved in the production, use, or 
      governance of AdMs to assess the sustainability of AdMs in a consistent, 
      objective, and quantitative way using a multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA)-based model. The model proposed herein adapts a triple-bottom-line (TBL) 
      framework from the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and incorporates 
      criteria weights identified through a stakeholder values assessment conducted by 
      surveying AdM practitioners. Results from the stakeholder values assessment show 
      that the perceived importance of the economic component of the TBL varies the 
      most across stakeholders, and that practitioners providing responses from the 
      perspective of a nongovernmental environmental advocacy group or a regulator of 
      AdMs such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency were more likely 
      to score and weigh economic indicators lower and environmental indicators higher 
      compared to when responding from a business owner perspective. The resulting 
      MCDA-based model allows stakeholders to assess the sustainability of an AdM or 
      AdM-enabled product and compare it to product alternatives, predict how other 
      stakeholders might score a product by identifying the extent to which components 
      of the TBL are valued by other stakeholders, and identify which subcriteria 
      contribute most to an improvement in a product's sustainability score. Integr

TI  - Treacle and Smallpox: Two Tests for Multicriteria Decision Analysis Models in 
      Health Technology Assessment.

AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is rightly receiving increasing attention 
      in health technology assessment. Nevertheless, a distinguishing feature of the 
      health domain is that technologies must actually improve health, and good 
      performance on other criteria cannot compensate for failure to do so. We argue 
      for two reasonable tests for MCDA models: the treacle test (can a winning 
      intervention be incompletely ineffective?) and the smallpox test (can a winning 
      intervention be for a disease that no one suffers from?). We explore why models 
      might fail such tests (as the models of some existing published studies would do) 
      and offer some suggestions as to how practice should be improved.

TI  - Early Health Technology Assessment during Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Drug 
      Development: A Two-Round, Cross-Country, Multicriteria Decision Analysis.
PG  - 830-845
LID - 10.1177/0272989X20940672 [doi]
AB  - Background. The assessment of value along the clinical development of new 
      biopharmaceutical compounds is a challenging task. Complex and uncertain evidence 
      has to be analyzed, considering a multitude of value preferences from different 
      stakeholders. Objective. To investigate the use of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) to support decision making during drug development while 
      considering payer and health technology assessment (HTA) value concerns, by 
      applying the Advance Value Framework in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and 
      testing for the consistency of the results. Design. A multiattribute value theory 
      methodology was applied and 2 rounds of decision conferences (DCs) were organized 
      in 3 countries (England, France, and Germany), with the participation of national 
      key experts and stakeholders using the MACBETH questioning protocol and 
      algorithm. A total of 51 health care professionals, patient advocates, and 
      methodologists, including (ex-) committee members or assessors from national HTA 
      bodies, participated in 6 DCs in the study countries. Target Population. NASH 
      patients in fibrosis stages F2 to 3 were considered. Interventions. The value of 
      a hypothetical product profile was assessed against 3 compounds under development 
      using their phase 2 results. Outcome Measures. DC participants' value preferences 
      were elicited involving criteria selection, options scoring, and criteria 
      weighting. Results. Highly consistent valuation rankings were observed in all 
      DCs, always favoring the same compound. Highly consistent rankings of criteria 
      clusters were observed, favoring therapeutic benefit criteria, followed by safety 
      profile and innovation level criteria. Limitations. There was a lack of 
      comparative treatment effects, early evidence on surrogate endpoints was used, 
      and stakeholder representativeness was limited in some DCs. Conclusions. The use 
      of MCDA is promising in supporting early HTA, illustrating high consistency in 
      results across countries and between study rounds.

TI  - Towards generic online multicriteria decision support in patient-centred health 
      care.
PG  - 689-702
LID - 10.1111/hex.12111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To introduce a new online generic decision support system based on 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), implemented in practical and 
      user-friendly software (Annalisa©). BACKGROUND: All parties in health care lack a 
      simple and generic way to picture and process the decisions to be made in pursuit 
      of improved decision making and more informed choice within an overall philosophy 
      of person- and patient-centred care. METHODS: The MCDA-based system generates 
      patient-specific clinical guidance in the form of an opinion as to the merits of 
      the alternative options in a decision, which are all scored and ranked. The 
      scores for each option combine, in a simple expected value calculation, the best 
      estimates available now for the performance of those options on 
      patient-determined criteria, with the individual patient's preferences, expressed 
      as importance weightings for those criteria. The survey software within which the 
      Annalisa file is embedded (Elicia©) customizes and personalizes the presentation 
      and inputs. Principles relevant to the development of such decision-specific 
      MCDA-based aids are noted and comparisons with alternative implementations 
      presented. The necessity to trade-off practicality (including resource 
      constraints) with normative rigour and empirical complexity, in both their 
      development and delivery, is emphasized. CONCLUSION: The MCDA-/Annalisa-based 
      decision support system represents a prescriptive addition to the portfolio of 
      decision-aiding tools available online to individuals and clinicians interested 
      in pursuing shared decision making and informed choice within a commitment to 
      transparency in relation to both the evidence and preference bases of decisions. 
      Some empirical data establishing its usability are provided.

PG  - 26-33

AB  - We focus on a class of multicriteria methods that are commonly used in 
      environmental decision making--those that employ the weighted linear average 
      algorithm (and this includes the popular analytic hierarchy process (AHP)). While 
      we do not doubt the potential benefits of using formal decision methods of this 
      type, we draw attention to the consequences of not using them well. In 
      particular, we highlight a property of these methods that should not be 
      overlooked when they are applied in environmental and wider decision-making 
      contexts: the final decision or ranking of options is dependent on the choice of 
      performance scoring scales for the criteria when the criteria weights are held 
      constant. We compare this "sensitivity" to a well-known criticism of the AHP, and 
      we go on to describe the more general lesson when it comes to using weighted 
      linear average methods--a lesson concerning the relationship between criteria 
      weights and performance scoring scales.

TI  - Evaluation of COPD Treatments: A Multicriteria Decision Analysis of Aclidinium

AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparisons of the use of aclidinium bromide and tiotropium bromide 
      for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often concentrate on 
      key end points (exacerbations) at the expense of other benefits and risks. 
      Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) can help overcome this by using 
      stakeholder preferences to combine multiple end points into an overall value 
      estimate. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of aclidinium bromide twice daily via 
      Pressair™ (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, DE) and of tiotropium once 
      daily via HandiHaler(®) (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, 
      CT) from the perspective of patients using MCDA. METHODS: Literature reviews and 
      clinician engagement were used to identify value criteria. Performance of 
      criteria was estimated from a clinical trial and clinician opinion. Scores and 
      swing weights came from six clinicians who, during a 2-day workshop, reflected 
      their patients' preferences. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were used to 
      explore uncertainty in model designs and inputs. RESULTS: Fourteen criteria, 
      covering clinical effectiveness, safety, and convenience of the treatments of 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were identified. Exacerbations and device 
      preloading were identified as the most important to patients; the least important 
      was rescue medication use. Tiotropium's higher overall clinical effectiveness 
      score was offset by aclidinium's better performance on safety and convenience 
      outcomes. The MCDA generated a -42 (worst performance) to 100 (best performance) 
      scale. The net impact of benefits over risks of aclidinium (38.5) exceeded that 
      of tiotropium (13.2), and patients preferred aclidinium 79.7% of the time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: When considering clinical benefits and risks, aclidinium and 
      tiotropium generate similar value to patients, but when convenience criteria are 
      considered, aclidinium may be preferred. Further work is required to replicate 
      these results, including eliciting preferences directly from patients.

AB  - A rough-interval-based multicriteria decision analysis method (RI-MCDA) is 
      developed for supporting the selection of remediation strategies for 
      1,1-dichloroethane contaminated sites. The concept of ''rough interval'' is 
      introduced in the design framework to represent dual-uncertain parameters. Three 
      rough-interval scenarios generated through pair-wise combining the values under 
      three confidence levels (i.e. 68.3%, 95.4% and 99.7%) and one deterministic 
      scenario adopted crisp numbers for parameters are introduced into the framework. 
      The proposed method is then applied to a contaminated site in the Pudong district 
      of Shanghai, China. Fifty remediation alternatives under four duration options 
      (i.e. 5, 10, 15, and 20 years) and ten criteria, including daily total pumping 
      rate, total cost and rough-interval risk information in light of uncertainty 
      parameter (e.g. slope factor), are taken into consideration to compare different 
      alternatives through RI-MCDA. Results indicated that the most desirable 
      remediation strategy lied in A25 for the 5-year, A10 for the 10-year, A15 for the 
      15-year, and A11 for the 20-year remediation. Compared to the traditional MCDA, 
      the proposed RI-MCDA shows the uniqueness in addressing the interaction between 
      dual intervals of highly uncertain parameters, as well as their joint impact on 
      the decision results, which reduces the subjectivity as much as possible.

TI  - Sustainability of Rearing System Using Multicriteria Analysis: Application in 
      Commercial Poultry Production.
LID - 10.3390/ani11123483 [doi]
LID - 3483
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop a multicriteria model for the 
      comparison of three commercial poultry farms: organic with Ross 308 genotype 
      (OR), organic with Naked Neck genotype (ONN) and a conventional system (C), which 
      represents the most common commercial farming system. A model based on 
      multicriteria decision analysis was developed, considering for the first time the 
      One Welfare approach in an operational manner, including three dimensions: human, 
      environmental and animal welfare. The three alternatives demonstrated different 
      performances, according to the different dimensions considered. In particular, 
      the two organic systems performed better for human welfare and animal welfare, 
      with relevant differences due to the genetic strains used. Conventional rearing 
      performed better for the environment index due to the method chosen. The 
      multicriteria analysis showed that the organic system performed better overall 
      than the conventional system. In particular, the use of an adapted Slow Growing 
      (SG) strain positively affected the final rank, mainly by reducing welfare 
      problems and producing good economic and social performance. The stability of the 
      results was verified by performing a sensitivity analysis, specifically a weight 
      stability analysis, which confirmed the strength of results.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis tools to two contaminated sediment 
      case studies.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Environmental decision making is becoming increasingly more information intensive 
      and complex. Our previous work shows that multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      tools offer a scientifically sound decision analytical framework for 
      environmental management, in general, and specifically for selecting optimal 
      sediment management alternatives. Integration of MCDA into risk assessment and 
      sediment management may require linkage of different models and software 
      platforms whose results may lead to somewhat different conclusions. This paper 
      illustrates the application of 3 different MCDA methods in 2 case studies 
      involving contaminated sediment management. These case studies are based on real 
      sediment management problems experienced by the US Army Corps of Engineers and 
      other stakeholders in New York/New Jersey Harbor, USA, and the Cocheco River 
      Superfund Site in New Hampshire, USA. Our analysis shows that application of 3 
      different MCDA tools points to similar management solutions no matter which tool 
      is applied. MCDA tools and approaches were constructively used to elicit the 
      strengths and weaknesses of each method when solving the problem.

TI  - Spatial multicriteria decision analysis of flood risks in aging-dam management in 
      China: a framework and case study.
PG  - 1368-87
LID - 10.3390/ijerph8051368 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 30,000 dams in China are aging and are considered to be high-level 
      risks. Developing a framework for analyzing spatial multicriteria flood risk is 
      crucial to ranking management scenarios for these dams, especially in densely 
      populated areas. Based on the theories of spatial multicriteria decision 
      analysis, this report generalizes a framework consisting of scenario definition, 
      problem structuring, criteria construction, spatial quantification of criteria, 
      criteria weighting, decision rules, sensitivity analyses, and scenario appraisal. 
      The framework is presented in detail by using a case study to rank dam 
      rehabilitation, decommissioning and existing-condition scenarios. The results 
      show that there was a serious inundation, and that a dam rehabilitation scenario 
      could reduce the multicriteria flood risk by 0.25 in the most affected areas; 
      this indicates a mean risk decrease of less than 23%. Although increased risk 
      (<0.20) was found for some residential and commercial buildings, if the dam were 
      to be decommissioned, the mean risk would not be greater than the current 
      existing risk, indicating that the dam rehabilitation scenario had a higher rank 
      for decreasing the flood risk than the decommissioning scenario, but that dam 
      rehabilitation alone might be of little help in abating flood risk. With 
      adjustments and improvement to the specific methods (according to the 
      circumstances and available data) this framework may be applied to other sites.

AB  - Influenza D virus (IDV) has been identified in several continents, with

      and cost-benefit of IDV surveillance in Togo, risk maps were drawn using a

      the relevance of sampling areas used so far. Areas at highest risk of IDV 
      occurrence were the main cattle markets. The maps were evaluated with previous 
      field surveillance data collected in Togo between 2017 and 2019: 1216 sera from 
      cattle, small ruminants, and swine were screened for antibodies to IDV by 
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. While further samples collections are 
      needed to validate the maps, the risk maps resulting from the spatial MCDA 
      approach generated here highlight several priority areas for IDV circulation 
      assessment.

TI  - Multicriteria decision analysis for determining drug therapy for intermittent 
      claudication.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - Drugs of various classes are prescribed for intermittent claudication. However, 
      there is some discrepancy between medical practice and the scientific basis for 
      drug selection. We have developed a quantitative criteria-based decision analysis 
      to evaluate all implications of drug treatment choices for intermittent 
      claudication. Pentoxifylline, buflomedil, naftidrofuryl and ticlopidine were the 
      drugs selected for analysis. The evaluation criteria were 1) therapeutic 
      efficacy, 2) safety, 3) patient acceptance and 4) cost. A review panel of experts 
      determined the relative importance of each criterion by assigning points (or 
      utility values) to each one. The points were 48, 20, 14 and 18, respectively, for 
      criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4. A probability value, or numerical estimate of how well a 
      drug meets a criterion, was assigned to each drug for each of the 4 criteria. The 
      probability value was multiplied by the utility value to determine the score for 
      each drug and criterion. The criteria points for each drug were added for a total 
      score for the drug. The drug with the highest overall score was pentoxifylline, 
      with 69 points out of an ideal score of 100. The rank order for the other drugs 
      was buflomedil, ticlopidine and naftidrofuryl. A sensitive analysis showed that 
      the relative ranking of the drugs remained unchanged over a series of data 
      modifications.

TI  - Assessment of irrigation water quality by a Geographic Information 
      System-Multicriteria Decision Analysis-based model: A case study from Ankara, 
      Turkey.
PG  - 1420-1432
LID - 10.1002/wer.1133 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the irrigation water quality of Eryaman region in Ankara (Turkey) 
      has been investigated using a Geographic Information System-Multicriteria 
      Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA)-based model. Two different irrigation water quality 
      indices (IWQI-A and IWQI-B) based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Data 
      Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been developed to provide a single suitability 
      score for all criteria of irrigation water quality. The irrigation water quality 
      indices were composed of 3 main criteria and 11 sub-criteria. Based on irrigation 
      water quality indices, four suitability classes have been identified as (a) 
      excellent, (b) good, (c) permissible, and (d) unsuitable. Irrigation water 
      quality maps were created by using kriging method and the water quality index 
      scores. The temporal variation of irrigation water quality was evaluated using 
      the models created for July 2007, 2010, and 2015 years. The most suitable areas 
      for irrigation water are concentrated in the eastern and western parts of the 
      region where the IWQI-B scores were >0.85. In recent years, the deterioration in 
      irrigation water quality has increased in the southern parts of the basin. This 
      research has demonstrated that the indices created by using DEA and AHP methods 
      are reliable indicators to assess irrigation water quality. PRACTITIONER POINTS: 
      Water quality indices can be used to depict the overall water quality status in 
      water management planning. To avoid problems when modeling groundwater quality, 
      the factors that have the most effect on water quality should be selected. 
      Analytic Hierarchy Process and Data Envelopment Analysis techniques are efficient 
      and reliable methods to determine water quality.

TI  - Surgical approaches for cam femoroacetabular impingement: the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 2509-16
LID - 10.1007/s11999-013-2934-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, three surgical approaches are available for the treatment 
      of cam femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), namely surgical hip dislocation (SHD), 
      hip arthroscopy (HA), and the miniopen anterior approach of the hip (MO). 
      Although previous systematic reviews have compared these different approaches, an 
      overall assessment of their performance is not available. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We 
      therefore executed a multidimensional structured comparison considering the 
      benefits, opportunities, costs, and risk (BOCR) of the different approaches using 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). METHODS: A MCDA using analytic 
      hierarchical process (AHP) was conducted to compare SHD, HA, and MO in terms of 
      BOCR on the basis of available evidence, institutional experience, costs, and our 
      understanding of pathophysiology of FAI. A preclinical decision-making model was 
      created for cam FAI to establish the surgical approach that better accomplishes 
      our objectives regarding the surgical treatment. A total score of an 
      alternative's utility and sensitivity analysis was established using commercially 
      available AHP software. RESULTS: The AHP model based on BOCR showed that MO is 
      the best surgical approach for cam FAI (normalized score: 0.38) followed by HA 
      (normalized score: 0.36) and SHD (normalized score: 0.25). The sensitivity 
      analysis showed that HA would turn into the best alternative if the variable 
      risks account for more than 61.8% of the priority during decision-making. In any 
      other decision-making scenario, MO remains as the best alternative. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using a recognized method for decision-making, this study provides supportive 
      data for the use of MO approach as our preferred surgical approach for cam FAI. 
      The latter is predominantly derived from the lower cost of this approach. Our 
      data may be considered a proxy performance measurement for surgical approaches in 
      cam FAI.

TI  - Diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection in Medicare patients: multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 3275-84
LID - 10.1007/s11999-014-3492-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the setting of finite healthcare resources, developing 
      cost-efficient strategies for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) diagnosis is 
      paramount. The current levels of knowledge allow for PJI diagnostic 
      recommendations based on scientific evidence but do not consider the benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks of the different diagnostic alternatives. 
      QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the best diagnostic strategy for knee and hip 
      PJI in the ambulatory setting for Medicare patients, utilizing benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks evaluation through multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA). METHODS: The PJI diagnostic definition supported by the 
      Musculoskeletal Infection Society was employed for the MCDA. Using a preclinical 
      model, we evaluated three diagnostic strategies that can be conducted in a 
      Medicare patient seen in the outpatient clinical setting complaining of a painful 
      TKA or THA. Strategies were (1) screening with serum markers (erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate [ESR]/C-reactive protein [CRP]) followed by arthrocentesis in 
      positive cases, (2) immediate arthrocentesis, and (3) serum markers requested 
      simultaneously with arthrocentesis. MCDA was conducted through the analytic 
      hierarchy process, comparing the diagnostic strategies in terms of benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks. RESULTS: Strategy 1 was the best alternative to 
      diagnose knee PJI among Medicare patients (normalized value: 0.490), followed by 
      Strategy 3 (normalized value: 0.403) and then Strategy 2 (normalized value: 
      0.106). The same ranking of alternatives was observed for the hip PJI model 
      (normalized value: 0.487, 0.405, and 0.107, respectively). The sensitivity 
      analysis found this sequence to be robust with respect to benefits, 
      opportunities, and risks. However, if during the decision-making process, cost 
      savings was given a priority of higher than 54%, the ranking for the preferred 
      diagnostic strategy changed. CONCLUSIONS: After considering the benefits, 
      opportunities, costs, and risks of the different available alternatives, our 
      preclinical model supports the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons 
      recommendations regarding the use of serum markers (ESR/CRP) before 
      arthrocentesis as the best diagnostic strategy for PJI among Medicare patients. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis. See Instructions to

TI  - Modelling habitat suitability in Jordan for the cutaneous leishmaniasis vector 
      (Phlebotomus papatasi) using multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - e0008852
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008852 [doi]
LID - e0008852
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a zoonotic vector-borne neglected tropical 
      disease transmitted by female Phlebotomine sand flies. It is distributed globally 
      but a large proportion of cases (70-75%) are found in just ten countries. CL is 
      endemic in Jordan yet there is a lack of robust entomological data and true 
      reporting status is unknown. This study aimed to map habitat suitability of the 
      main CL vector, Phlebotomus papatasi, in Jordan as a proxy for CL risk 
      distribution to (i) identify areas potentially at risk of CL and (ii) estimate 
      the human population at risk of CL. A literature review identified potential 
      environmental determinants for P. papatasi occurrence including temperature, 
      humidity, precipitation, vegetation, wind speed, presence of human households and 
      presence of the fat sand rat. Each predictor variable was (a) mapped; (b) 
      standardized to a common size, resolution and scale using fuzzy membership 
      functions; (c) assigned a weight using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP); 
      and (d) included within a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to produce 
      monthly maps illustrating the predicted habitat suitability (between 0 and 1) for 
      P. papatasi in Jordan. Suitability increased over the summer months and was 
      generally highest in the north-western regions of the country and along the 
      Jordan Valley, areas which largely coincided with highly populated parts of the 
      country, including areas where Syrian refugee camps are located. Habitat 
      suitability in Jordan for the main CL vector-P. papatasi-was heterogeneous over 
      both space and time. Suitable areas for P. papatasi coincided with highly 
      populated areas of Jordan which suggests that the targeted implementation of 
      control and surveillance strategies in defined areas such as those with very high 
      CL vector suitability (>0.9 suitability) would focus only on 3.42% of the 
      country's total geographic area, whilst still including a substantial proportion 
      of the population at risk: estimates range from 72% (European Commission's Global 
      Human Settlement population grid) to 89% (Gridded Population of the World) 
      depending on the human population density data used. Therefore, high impact 
      public health interventions could be achieved within a reduced spatial target, 
      thus maximizing the efficient use of resources.

TI  - Feasibility of Measuring Preferences for Chemotherapy Among Early-Stage Breast 
      Cancer Survivors Using a Direct Rank Ordering Multicriteria Decision Analysis 
      Versus a Time Trade-Off.
PG  - 557-566
LID - 10.1007/s40271-020-00423-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chemotherapy is increasingly a preference-based choice among women 
      diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      is a promising but underutilized method to facilitate shared decision making. We 
      explored the feasibility of conducting an MCDA using direct rank ordering versus 
      a time trade-off (TTO) to assess chemotherapy choice in a large population-based 
      sample. METHODS: We surveyed 904 early-stage breast cancer survivors who were 
      within 5 years of diagnosis and reported to the Western Washington State Cancer 
      System and Kaiser Permanente Northern California registries. Direct rank ordering 
      of 11 criteria and TTO surveys were conducted from September 2015 to July 2016; 
      clinical data were obtained from registries or medical records. Multivariable 
      regressions estimated post hoc associations between the MCDA, TTO, and 
      self-reported chemotherapy receipt, considering covariates. RESULTS: Survivors 
      ranged in age from 25 to 74 years and 73.9% had stage I tumors. The response rate 
      for the rank ordering was 81.0%; TTO score was 94.2%. A one-standard deviation 
      increase in the difference between the chemotherapy and no chemotherapy MCDA 
      scores was associated with a 75.1% (95% confidence interval 43.9-109.7%; 
      p < 0.001) increase in the adjusted odds of having received chemotherapy; no 
      association was found between the TTO score and chemotherapy receipt. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A rank-order-based MCDA was feasible and was associated with 
      chemotherapy choice. Future research should consider developing and testing this 
      MCDA for use in clinical encounters. Additional research is required to develop a 
      TTO-based model and test its properties against a pragmatic MCDA to inform future 
      shared decision-making tools.

TI  - Evaluating the Application of Decision Analysis Methods in Simulated Alternatives 
      Assessment Case Studies: Potential Benefits and Challenges of Using MCDA.
PG  - 27-41
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4316 [doi]
AB  - We compare how several forms of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) can 
      enhance the practice of alternatives assessment (AA). We report on a workshop in 
      which 12 practitioners from US corporations, government agencies, NGOs, and 
      consulting organizations applied different MCDA techniques to 3 AA case studies 
      to understand how they improved the decision process. Participants were asked to 
      select a preferred alternative in each case using a different decision analysis 
      approach: their unaided decision-making method, individual or lightly facilitated 
      group multiattribute value theory (MAVT), and more extensively facilitated group 
      structured decision making (SDM). Surveys conducted after each exercise revealed 
      that participants were positive toward the use of formal decision-making methods 
      for AA, reporting meaningful increases in their understanding of the trade-offs 
      involved and their own values. Participants also reported challenges with each 
      approach. While the MCDA techniques were reported to enhance transparency and 
      communication, they did not consistently lead to higher satisfaction with a 
      decision and/or outcome, and they were not more likely to be adopted within their 
      organizations than unaided approaches. More formal decision-making methods have 
      promise in the context of AA, but practitioners will need more guidance to use 
      such tools successfully. Practitioners will also need to define what "success" 
      constitutes; different approaches may be called for depending on whether the 
      objective is increased understanding, satisfaction with the outcome, satisfaction 
      with the process, or something else. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;17:27-41. ©

AB  - The selection of remedial alternatives for mine sites is a complex task because 
      it involves multiple criteria and often with conflicting objectives. However, an 
      existing framework used to select remedial alternatives lacks multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) aids and does not consider uncertainty in the selection 
      of alternatives. The objective of this paper is to improve the existing framework 
      by introducing deterministic and probabilistic MCDA methods. The Preference 
      Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) methods have 
      been implemented in this study. The MCDA analysis involves processing inputs to 
      the PROMETHEE methods that are identifying the alternatives, defining the 
      criteria, defining the criteria weights using analytical hierarchical process 
      (AHP), defining the probability distribution of criteria weights, and conducting 
      Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS); running the PROMETHEE methods using these inputs; 
      and conducting a sensitivity analysis. A case study was presented to demonstrate 
      the improved framework at a mine site. The results showed that the improved 
      framework provides a reliable way of selecting remedial alternatives as well as 
      quantifying the impact of different criteria on selecting alternatives.

PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-10-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systematic and transparent approaches to priority setting are needed, 
      particularly in low-resource settings, to produce decisions that are sound and 
      acceptable to stakeholders. The EVIDEM framework brings together Health 
      Technology Assessment (HTA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) by 
      proposing a comprehensive set of decision criteria together with standardized 
      processes to support decisionmaking. The objective of the study was to field test 
      the framework for decisionmaking on a screening test by a private health plan in 
      South Africa. METHODS: Liquid-based cytology (LBC) for cervical cancer screening 
      was selected by the health plan for this field test. An HTA report structured by 
      decision criterion (14 criteria organized in the MCDA matrix and 4 contextual 
      criteria) was produced based on a literature review and input from the health 
      plan. During workshop sessions, committee members 1) weighted each MCDA decision 
      criterion to express their individual perspectives, and 2) to appraise LBC, 
      assigned scores to each MCDA criterion on the basis of the by-criterion HTA 
      report.Committee members then considered the potential impacts of four contextual 
      criteria on the use of LBC in the context of their health plan. Feedback on the 
      framework and process was collected through discussion and from a questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: For 9 of the MCDA matrix decision criteria, 89% or more of committee 
      members thought they should always be considered in decisionmaking. Greatest 
      weights were given to the criteria "Budget impact", "Cost-effectiveness" and 
      "Completeness and consistency of reporting evidence". When appraising LBC for 
      cervical cancer screening, the committee assigned the highest scores to 
      "Relevance and validity of evidence" and "Disease severity". Combination of 
      weights and scores yielded a mean MCDA value estimate of 46% (SD 7%) of the 
      potential maximum value. Overall, the committee felt the framework brought 
      greater clarity to the decisionmaking process and was easily adaptable to 
      different types of health interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The EVIDEM framework was 
      easily adapted to evaluating a screening technology in South Africa, thereby 
      broadening its applicability in healthcare decision making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the proven value of multicriteria decision analysis in the 
      health field, there is a lack of studies focused on prioritising victims in the 
      Emergency Medical Service, EMS. With this, and knowing that the decision maker 
      needs a direction on which choice may be the most appropriate, based on different 
      and often conflicting criteria. The current work developed a new model for 
      prioritizing victims of SAMU/192, based on the multicriteria decision 
      methodology, taking into account the scarcity of resources. METHODS: An expert 
      panel and a discussion group were formed, which defined the limits of the 
      problem, and identified the evaluation criteria for choosing a victim, amongst 
      four alternatives illustrated from hypothetical scenarios of emergency 
      situations-clinical and traumatic diseases of absolute priority. For 
      prioritization, an additive mathematical method was used that aggregates criteria 
      in a flexible and interactive version, FITradeoff. RESULTS: The structuring of 
      the problem led the researchers to identify twenty-five evaluation criteria, 
      amongst which ten were essential to guide decisions. As a result, in the 
      simulation of prioritization of four requesting victims in view of the 
      availability of only one ambulance, the proposed model supported the decision by 
      suggesting the prioritization of one of the victims. CONCLUSIONS: This work 
      contributed to the prioritization of victims using multicriteria decision support 
      methodology. Selecting and weighing the criteria in this study indicated that the 
      protocols that guide regulatory physicians do not consider all the criteria for 
      prioritizing victims in an environment of scarcity of resources. Finally, the 
      proposed model can support crucial decision based on a rational and transparent 
      decision-making process that can be applied in other EMS.

AB  - This study presents a novel support tool for the optimization and development of 
      analytical methods. The tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), 
      namely the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution 
      (TOPSIS), that allows users to rank possible solutions according to their 
      requirements. In this study, we performed rankings of pairs of eight extraction 
      and three dispersive solvents used in DLLME for chlorophenols extraction from 
      water samples. The first ranking involved sensitivity and precision of the method 
      for each of the nine chlorophenols. The tool is a quantitative solution to the 
      common analytical problem that the change of analytical performance results in 
      better performance for some analytes and worse for others. The second ranking 
      included the assessment of the greenness of each pair of solvents, based on 
      toxicological, ecotoxicological and environmental persistence criteria. The third 
      ranking was based on a combination of sensitivity, precision and greenness 
      criteria. Heptane as an extraction solvent and acetone as a dispersive solvent 
      were selected as the most appropriate ones. The TOPSIS tool is a successful, easy 
      to implement, incorporation of green analytical chemistry values to analytical 
      method optimization.

PG  - 635-44
AB  - This study supported the evaluation by a rehabilitation team of the performance 
      of two treatment options that improve the arm-hand function in subjects with 
      sixth cervical vertebra (C6) level Motor Group 2 tetraplegia. The analytic 
      hierarchy process, a technique for multicriteria decision analysis, was used by a 
      rehabilitation team and potential recipients to quantitatively compare a new 
      technology, Functional Elec trical Stimulation (FES), with conventional surgery. 
      Perform-ance was measured by functional improvement, treatment load, risks, 
      user-friendliness, and social outcomes. Functional improvement after FES was 
      considered better than that after conventional surgery. However, the 
      rehabilitation team's overall rating for conventional surgery was slightly higher 
      than that for FES (57% vs 44%). Compared with the rehabilitation team, potential 
      recipients gave greater weight to burden of treatment and less weight to 
      functional improvement. This study shows that evaluation of new technology must 
      be more comprehensive than the evaluation of functional improvement alone, and 
      that patient preferences may differ from those of the rehabilitation team.

AB  - Weight of evidence (WOE) methods are key components of ecological and human 
      health risk assessments. Most WOE applications rely on the qualitative 
      integration of diverse lines of evidence (LOE) representing impact on ecological 
      receptors and humans. Recent calls for transparency in assessments and 
      justifiability of management decisions are pushing the community to consider 
      quantitative methods for integrated risk assessment and management. This article 
      compares and contrasts the type of information required for application of 
      individual WOE techniques and the outcomes that they provide in ecological risk 
      assessment and proposes a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework for 
      integrating individual LOE in support of management decisions. The use of 
      quantitative WOE techniques is illustrated for a hypothetical but realistic case 
      study of selecting remedial alternatives at a contaminated aquatic site. Use of 
      formal MCDA does not necessarily eliminate biases and judgment calls necessary 
      for selecting remedial alternatives, but allows for transparent evaluation and 
      fusion of individual LOE. It also provides justifiable methods for selecting 
      remedial alternatives consistent with stakeholder and decision-maker values.

TI  - An assessment of site suitability for marina construction in Istanbul, Turkey, 
      using GIS and AHP multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 677
AB  - Marinas play a key role in sea transportation and tourism. The problem of an 
      insufficient marina capacity has revealed in terms of sea traffic due to the 
      demographic structure and increasing tourism potential of Istanbul which is the 
      biggest metropolitan city of Turkey and has around 600-km-long coastline. 
      Therefore, the study area is mainly focused on the Marmara Sea shoreline of 
      Istanbul. Rather than traditional methods, a rapid and cost-effective solution 
      which considers natural and urban environment conditions is essential to satisfy 
      the need for a marina site selection. Thanks to the latest improvements in 
      geographic information systems, it is convenient to perform location selection 
      analysis of marinas taking advantages of geology, land use, demography and 
      accessibility data sets. The goal of this study is to define the areas that are 
      appropriate for building marinas, with the use of topographic and demographic 
      data in a present shoreline applying analytical hierarchy process multicriteria 
      decision-making method. In this study, erosion, landslide, tsunami, land use, 
      geologically hazardous areas, transfer lines, sea traffic data, neighbourhood 
      scale population, age patterns and house income data have been used. Analytical 
      hierarchy process method is used to give a weight to each data set, and a grading 
      system has been developed for the area selection of marinas. The result maps of 
      the analysis that show study area as classified into four categories from good to 
      not suitable are presented. It is possible to create a decision support system 
      for upper scale plans that enable authorities to perform analysis accurately, 
      cost and time effectively using the proposed methodology that integrates multiple 
      data sets with different scales and types.

      Equipment.
PG  - 2346-2357
LID - 10.1002/ceat.201800287 [doi]
AB  - For the first time, a two-stage decision support framework for equipment 
      selection, applied to biomass separation, is presented. In the first stage, the 
      framework evaluates from a number of equipment based on the process requirements 
      and outputs only those that offer a technically feasible separation. In the 
      second stage, the analytic hierarchy process is applied for performing a 
      multicriteria decision analysis to select amongst the feasible equipment based on 
      separation performance and energy consumption criteria. This approach 
      systematically considers the relative importance of those different alternatives 
      and selection criteria by pairwise comparisons. The output of the framework is an 
      overall ranking of equipment as well as a sensitivity analysis of the results for 
      different weighting of the criteria. These results can be used to equip 
      practitioners in the field of bioseparations with a tool for making more 
      consistent and better-informed equipment selection decisions.

TI  - Bridging health technology assessment (HTA) and efficient health care decision 
      making with multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA): applying the EVIDEM framework 
      to medicines appraisal.
PG  - 376-88
LID - 10.1177/0272989X11416870 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care decision making is complex and requires efficient and 
      explicit processes to ensure transparency and consistency of factors considered. 
      OBJECTIVES: To pilot an adaptable decision-making framework incorporating 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) in health technology assessment (HTA) with 
      a pan-Canadian group of policy and clinical decision makers and researchers 
      appraising 10 medicines covering 6 therapeutic areas. METHODS: An appraisal group 
      was convened and participants were asked to express their individual 
      perspectives, independently of the medicines, by assigning weights to each 
      criterion of the MCDA core model: disease severity, size of population, current 
      practice and unmet needs, intervention outcomes (efficacy, safety, patient 
      reported), type of health benefit, economics, and quality of evidence. 
      Participants then assigned performance scores for each medicine using available 
      evidence synthesized in a "by-criterion" HTA report covering each of the MCDA 
      CORE model criteria. MCDA estimates of perceived value were calculated by 
      combining normalized weights and scores. Feedback on the approach was collected 
      through structured discussion. RESULTS: Relative weights on criteria varied 
      widely, reflecting the diverse perspectives of participants. Scores for each 
      criterion provided a performance measure, highlighting strengths and weaknesses 
      of each medicine. MCDA estimates of perceived value ranged from 0.42 to 0.64 
      across medicines, providing comprehensive measures incorporating a large spectrum 
      of criteria. Participants reported that the framework provided an efficient 
      approach to systematic consideration in a pragmatic format of the multiple 
      elements guiding decision, including criteria and values (MCDA core model) and 
      evidence (HTA "by-criterion" report). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study 
      demonstrated the usefulness of incorporating MCDA in HTA to support transparent 
      and systematic appraisal of health care interventions. Further research is needed 
      to advance MCDA-based approaches to more effective healthcare decision making.

TI  - Benefit, risk and cost of new oral anticoagulants and warfarin in atrial 
      fibrillation; A multicriteria decision analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Warfarin and new oral anticoagulants are effective in reducing 
      stroke in atrial fibrillation; however, the benefits and risks rates in clinical 
      trials show heterogeneity for each anticoagulant, and is unknown the cost 
      influence on a model considering most of the treatment consequences. We designed 
      a benefit-risk and cost assessment of oral anticoagulants. DESIGN: We followed 
      the roadmap proposed by IMI-PROTECT and the considerations of emerged good 
      practice to perform Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The roadmap defines 
      the following steps: (1) planning, (2) evidence gathering and data preparation, 
      (3) analyses, (4) explorations, and (5) conclusions. We defined two reference 
      points (0-100) to allocate numerical values for scores and weights, and used an 
      analogue numeric scale to assess physicians' preferences. As benefits of the 
      anticoagulant therapy, we included reductions in stroke and all-cause mortality; 
      intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, minor bleeding and 
      myocardial infarction were considered risks. We also made an estimation of the 
      annual drug cost per person. MAIN RESULTS: The scores were: Apixaban 33, 
      Dabigatrán 25, warfarin 18 and Rivaroxaban 14 this score reveals the most 
      preferred up to the less preferred option, considering the benefit-risk ratio and 
      drug costs altogether. The relative model weights were: 51.1% for risks, 40.4% 
      for benefits and 8.5% for cost. The sensitivity analysis confirms the model 
      robustness. CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis, apixaban should be considered as the 
      preferred anticoagulant option -due to a better benefit-risk balance and a minor 
      cost influence- followed by dabigatran, warfarin and rivaroxaban.

AB  - Landslides are geomorphological phenomena that affect anthropogenic and natural 
      features on the Earth's surface. Many previous studies have identified several 
      factors that have contributed to landslides. Among these factors are physical 
      characteristics, such as slope, aspect, and land cover, of Earth's surface. 
      Moreover, landslides can be triggered by human activities such as underground 
      mining. This study aims to identify landslide susceptibility areas by analyzing 
      landslide-related factors, including land subsidence triggered by underground 
      mining. The area of interest was Kozlu, Turkey, where underground mining has been 
      in progress for the past 100 years. Thus, to identify landslide risk zones, the 
      multicriteria decision analysis method, together with the analytical hierarchy 
      method, was used. The datasets included were topography, land cover, geological 
      settings, and mining-induced land subsidence. The spatial extent of land 
      subsidence was estimated using a previously published model. A landslide 
      susceptibility map (LSM) was developed using a purposely developed GIS-based 
      software. The results were compared with a terrain deformation map, which was 
      developed in a separate study using the differential synthetic aperture radar 
      interferometry (DInSAR) technique. The results showed a substantial correlation 
      between the LSM and DInSAR map. Furthermore, it was found that ~ 88% of the very 
      high and high landslide risk areas coincided with location of the past landslide 
      events. These facts suggest that the algorithm and data sources used were 
      sufficient to produce a sufficiently accurate LSM, which may be used for various 
      purposes such as urban planning.

TI  - Application of multicriteria decision analysis to jar-test results for chemicals 
      selection in the physical-chemical treatment of textile wastewater.
PG  - 288-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.046 [doi]
AB  - Jar-test is a well-known tool for chemicals selection for physical-chemical 
      wastewater treatment. Jar-test results show the treatment efficiency in terms of 
      suspended matter and organic matter removal. However, in spite of having all 
      these results, coagulant selection is not an easy task because one coagulant can 
      remove efficiently the suspended solids but at the same time increase the 
      conductivity or increase considerably the sludge production containing chemicals 
      and toxic dyes. This makes the final selection of coagulants very dependent on 
      the relative importance assigned to each measured parameter. In this paper, the 
      use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is proposed to help on the 
      selection of the coagulant and its concentration in the physical-chemical 
      wastewater treatment, since textile wastewater contains hazardous substances. 
      Therefore, starting from the parameters fixed by the jar-test results, these 
      techniques will allow to weight these parameters, according to the judgements of 
      wastewater experts, and to establish priorities among coagulants. Two well-known 
      MCDA techniques have been used: analytic hierarchic process (AHP) and preference 
      ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEEs) and their 
      results were compared. The method proposed has been applied to the particular 
      case of textile wastewaters. The results obtained show that MCDA techniques are 
      useful tools to select the chemicals for the physical-technical treatment.

TI  - Food Supply without Risk: Multicriteria Analysis of Institutional Conditions of 
      Exporters.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17103432 [doi]
LID - 3432
AB  - International trade in food knows no borders, hence the need for prevention 
      systems to avoid the consumption of products that are harmful to health. This 
      paper proposes the use of multicriteria risk prevention tools that consider the 
      socioeconomic and institutional conditions of food exporters. We propose the use 
      of three decision-making methods-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to 
      the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realité 
      (ELECTRE), and Cross-Efficiency (CE)-to establish a ranking of countries that 
      export cereals to the European Union, based on structural criteria related to the 
      detection of potential associated risks (notifications, food quality, corruption, 
      environmental sustainability in agriculture, and logistics). In addition, the 
      analysis examines whether the wealth and institutional capacity of supplier 
      countries influence their position in the ranking. The research was carried out 
      biannually over the period from 2012-2016, allowing an assessment to be made of 
      the possible stability of the markets. The results reveal that suppliers' 
      rankings based exclusively on aspects related to food risk differ from importers' 
      actual choices determined by micro/macroeconomic features (price, production 
      volume, and economic growth). The rankings obtained by the three proposed methods 
      are not the same, but present certain similarities, with the ability to discern 
      countries according to their level of food risk. The proposed methodology can be 
      applied to support sourcing strategies. In the future, food safety considerations 
      could have increased influence in importing decisions, which would involve 
      further difficulties for low-income countries.

TI  - An uncertainty and sensitivity analysis approach for GIS-based multicriteria 
      landslide susceptibility mapping.
PG  - 610-638
AB  - GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are increasingly being 
      used in landslide susceptibility mapping. However, the uncertainties that are 
      associated with MCDA techniques may significantly impact the results. This may 
      sometimes lead to inaccurate outcomes and undesirable consequences. This article 
      introduces a new GIS-based MCDA approach. We illustrate the consequences of 
      applying different MCDA methods within a decision-making process through 
      uncertainty analysis. Three GIS-MCDA methods in conjunction with Monte Carlo 
      simulation (MCS) and Dempster-Shafer theory are analyzed for landslide 
      susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the Urmia lake basin in Iran, which is highly 
      susceptible to landslide hazards. The methodology comprises three stages. First, 
      the LSM criteria are ranked and a sensitivity analysis is implemented to simulate 
      error propagation based on the MCS. The resulting weights are expressed through 
      probability density functions. Accordingly, within the second stage, three MCDA 
      methods, namely analytical hierarchy process (AHP), weighted linear combination 
      (WLC) and ordered weighted average (OWA), are used to produce the landslide 
      susceptibility maps. In the third stage, accuracy assessments are carried out and 
      the uncertainties of the different results are measured. We compare the 
      accuracies of the three MCDA methods based on (1) the Dempster-Shafer theory and 
      (2) a validation of the results using an inventory of known landslides and their 
      respective coverage based on object-based image analysis of IRS-ID satellite 
      images. The results of this study reveal that through the integration of GIS and 
      MCDA models, it is possible to identify strategies for choosing an appropriate 
      method for LSM. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the integration of MCDA 
      and MCS can significantly improve the accuracy of the results. In LSM, the AHP 
      method performed best, while the OWA reveals better performance in the 
      reliability assessment. The WLC operation yielded poor results.

TI  - From "weight of evidence" to quantitative data integration using multicriteria 
      decision analysis and Bayesian methods.
PG  - 3-8
LID - 10.14573/altex.1412231 [doi]
AB  - "Weighing" available evidence in the process of decision-making is unavoidable, 
      yet it is one step that routinely raises suspicions: what evidence should be 
      used, how much does it weigh, and whose thumb may be tipping the scales? This 
      commentary aims to evaluate the current state and future roles of various types 
      of evidence for hazard assessment as it applies to environmental health. In its 
      recent evaluation of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk 
      Information System assessment process, the National Research Council committee 
      singled out the term "weight of evidence" (WoE) for critique, deeming the process 
      too vague and detractive to the practice of evaluating human health risks of 
      chemicals. Moving the methodology away from qualitative, vague and controversial 
      methods towards generalizable, quantitative and transparent methods for 
      appropriately managing diverse lines of evidence is paramount for both regulatory 
      and public acceptance of the hazard assessments. The choice of terminology 
      notwithstanding, a number of recent Bayesian WoE-based methods, the emergence of 
      multi criteria decision analysis for WoE applications, as well as the general 
      principles behind the foundational concepts of WoE, show promise in how to move 
      forward and regain trust in the data integration step of the assessments. We 
      offer our thoughts on the current state of WoE as a whole and while we 
      acknowledge that many WoE applications have been largely qualitative and 
      subjective in nature, we see this as an opportunity to turn WoE towards a 
      quantitative direction that includes Bayesian and multi criteria decision 
      analysis.

TI  - Health care priority setting in Norway a multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-12-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Priority setting in population health is increasingly based on 
      explicitly formulated values. The Patients Rights Act of the Norwegian tax-based 
      health service guaranties all citizens health care in case of a severe illness, a 
      proven health benefit, and proportionality between need and treatment. This study 
      compares the values of the country's health policy makers with these three 
      official principles. METHODS: In total 34 policy makers participated in a 
      discrete choice experiment, weighting the relative value of six policy criteria. 
      We used multi-variate logistic regression with selection as dependent valuable to 
      derive odds ratios for each criterion. Next, we constructed a composite league 
      table - based on the sum score for the probability of selection - to rank 
      potential interventions in five major disease areas. RESULTS: The group 
      considered cost effectiveness, large individual benefits and severity of disease 
      as the most important criteria in decision making. Priority interventions are 
      those related to cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. Less 
      attractive interventions rank those related to mental health. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Norwegian policy makers' values are in agreement with principles formulated in 
      national health laws. Multi-criteria decision approaches may provide a tool to 
      support explicit allocation decisions.

TI  - Combining GIS with fuzzy multicriteria decision-making for landfill siting in a 
      fast-growing urban region.
PG  - 139-53
AB  - Landfill siting is a difficult, complex, tedious, and protracted process 
      requiring evaluation of many different criteria. This paper presents a fuzzy 
      multicriteria decision analysis alongside with a geospatial analysis for the 
      selection of landfill sites. It employs a two-stage analysis synergistically to 
      form a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for waste management in a 
      fast-growing urban region, south Texas. The first-stage analysis makes use of the 
      thematic maps in Geographical information system (GIS) in conjunction with 
      environmental, biophysical, ecological, and socioeconomic variables leading to 
      support the second-stage analysis using the fuzzy multicriteria decision-making 
      (FMCDM) as a tool. It differs from the conventional methods of integrating GIS 
      with MCDM for landfill selection because the approach follows two sequential 
      steps rather than a full-integrated scheme. The case study was made for the city 
      of Harlingen in south Texas, which is rapidly evolving into a large urban area 
      due to its vantage position near the US-Mexico borderlands. The purpose of GIS 
      was to perform an initial screening process to eliminate unsuitable land followed 
      by utilization of FMCDM method to identify the most suitable site using the 
      information provided by the regional experts with reference to five chosen 
      criteria. Research findings show that the proposed SDSS may aid in recognizing 
      the pros and cons of potential areas for the localization of landfill sites in 
      any study region. Based on initial GIS screening and final FMCDM assessment, 
      "site 1" was selected as the most suitable site for the new landfill in the 
      suburban area of the City of Harlingen. Sensitivity analysis was performed using 
      Monte Carlo simulation where the decision weights associated with all criteria 
      were varied to investigate their relative impacts on the rank ordering of the 
      potential sites in the second stage. Despite variations of the decision weights 
      within a range of 20%, it shows that "site 1" remains its comparative advantage 
      in the final site selection process.

TI  - A quantitative benefit-risk assessment approach to improve decision making in 
      drug development: Application of a multicriteria decision analysis model in the 
      development of combination therapy for overactive bladder.
PG  - 442-51
LID - 10.1002/cpt.271 [doi]
AB  - A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was developed and used to 
      estimate the benefit-risk of solifenacin and mirabegron and their combination in 
      the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The objectives were 1) to develop an 
      MCDA tool to compare drug effects in OAB quantitatively, 2) to establish 
      transparency in the evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of various dose 
      combinations, and 3) to quantify the added value of combination use compared to 
      monotherapies. The MCDA model was developed using efficacy, safety, and 
      tolerability attributes and the results of a phase II factorial design 
      combination study were evaluated. Combinations of solifenacin 5 mg and mirabegron 
      25 mg and mirabegron 50 (5+25 and 5+50) scored the highest clinical utility and 
      supported combination therapy development of solifenacin and mirabegron for phase 
      III clinical development at these dose regimens. This case study underlines the 
      benefit of using a quantitative approach in clinical drug development programs.

TI  - A benefit-risk assessment model for statins using multicriteria decision analysis 
      based on a discrete choice experiment in Korean patients.
PG  - 965-74
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S100438 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The benefit-risk balance for drugs can alter post approval owing to 
      additional data on efficacy or adverse events. This study developed a 
      quantitative benefit-risk assessment (BRA) model for statins using multicriteria 
      decision analysis with discrete choice experiments and compared a recent BRA with 
      that at the time of approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Following a systematic review 
      of the literature, the benefit criteria within the statin BRA model were defined 
      as a reduction in the plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and a 
      reduction in myocardial infarction incidence; the risk criteria were 
      hepatotoxicity (Liv) and fatal rhabdomyolysis (Rha). The scores for these 
      criteria were estimated using mixed treatment comparison methods. Weighting was 
      calculated from a discrete choice experiment involving 203 Korean patients. The 
      scores and weights were integrated to produce an overall value representing the 
      benefit-risk balance, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In this 
      BRA model, low-density lipoprotein (relative importance [RI]: 37.50%) was found 
      to be a more important benefit criterion than myocardial infarction (RI: 35.43%), 
      and Liv (RI: 16.28%) was a more important risk criterion than Rha (RI: 10.79%). 
      Patients preferred atorvastatin, and the preference ranking of cerivastatin and 
      simvastatin was switched post approval because of the emergence of additional 
      risk information related to cerivastatin. CONCLUSION: A quantitative statin BRA 
      model confirmed that the preference ranking of statins changed post approval 
      because of the identification of additional benefits or risks.

TI  - Balancing equity and efficiency in health priorities in Ghana: the use of 
      multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1081-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00392.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To guide the Ministry of Health in Ghana in the priority setting of 
      interventions by quantifying the trade-off between equity, efficiency, and other 
      societal concerns in health. METHODS: The study applied a multicriteria decision 
      analytical framework. A focus group of seven policymakers identified the relevant 
      criteria for priority setting and 63 policymakers participated in a discrete 
      choice experiment to weigh their relative importance. Regression analysis was 
      used to rank order a set of health interventions on the basis of these criteria 
      and associated weights. RESULTS: Policymakers in Ghana consider targeting of 
      vulnerable populations and cost-effectiveness as the most important criteria for 
      priority setting of interventions, followed by severity of disease, number of 
      beneficiaries, and diseases of the poor. This translates into a general 
      preference for interventions in child health, reproductive health, and 
      communicable diseases. CONCLUSION: Study results correspond with the overall 
      vision of the Ministry of Health in Ghana, and are instrumental in the assessment 
      of present and future investments in health. Multicriteria decision analysis 
      contributes to transparency and accountability in policymaking.

      birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many healthcare services are under considerable pressure to reduce 
      costs while improving quality. This is particularly true in the United Kingdom's 
      National Health Service where postnatal care is sometimes viewed as having a low 
      priority. There is much debate about the service's redesign and the reallocation 
      of resources, both along care pathways and between groups of mothers and babies 
      with different needs. The aim of this study was to develop a decision support 
      tool that would encourage a systemic approach to service redesign and that could 
      assess the various quality and financial implications of service change options 
      making the consequent trade-offs explicit. The paper describes the development 
      process and an initial implementation as a preliminary exploration of the 
      possible merits of this approach. METHODS: Other studies have suggested that 
      combining multicriteria decision analysis with programme budgeting and marginal 
      analysis might offer a suitable basis for resource allocation decisions in 
      healthcare systems. The Postnatal care Resource Allocation Model incorporated 
      this approach in a decision support tool to analyse the consequences of varying 
      design parameters, notably staff contacts and time, on the various quality 
      domains and costs. The initial phase of the study focussed on mapping postnatal 
      care, involving interviews and workshops with a variety of stakeholders. This was 
      supplemented with a literature review and the resultant knowledge base was 
      encoded in the decision support tool. The model was then tested with various 
      stakeholders before being used in an NHS Trust in England. RESULTS: The model 
      provides practical support, helping staff explore options and articulate their 
      proposals for the redesign of postnatal care. The integration of cost and quality 
      domains facilitates trade-offs, allowing staff to explore the benefits of 
      reallocating resources between hospital and community-based care, and different 
      patient-categories. CONCLUSIONS: The main benefits of the model include its 
      structure for assembling the key data, sharing evidence amongst 
      multi-professional teams and encouraging constructive, systemic debate. Although 
      the model was developed in the context of the routine maternity services for 
      mothers and babies in the days following birth it could be adapted for use in 
      other health care services.

AB  - Policymakers tend to focus on improving patented drug policies because they are 
      under pressure from patients, physicians, and manufacturers to increase access to 
      novel therapies. The success of pharmaceutical innovation over the last few 
      decades has led to the availability of many off-patent drugs to treat disease 
      areas with the greatest public health need. Therefore, the success of public 
      health programs in improving the health status of the total population is highly 
      dependent on the efficiency of generic drug policies. The objective of this 
      article was to explore factors influencing the true efficiency of generic 
      prescription drug policies in supporting public health initiatives in the 
      developed world. Health care decision makers often assess the efficiency of 
      generic drug policies by the level of price erosion and market share of generics. 
      Drug quality, bioequivalence, in some cases drug formulations, supply 
      reliability, medical adherence and persistence, health outcomes, and nondrug 
      costs, however, are also attributes of success for generic drug policies. Further 
      methodological research is needed to measure and improve the efficiency of 
      generic drug policies. This also requires extension of the evidence base of the 
      impact of generic drugs, partly based on real-world evidence. Multicriteria 
      decision analysis may assist policymakers and researchers to evaluate the true 
      value of generic drugs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the readers are introduced to ELICIT, an imprecise 
      weight elicitation technique for multicriteria decision analysis for healthcare. 
      METHODS: The application of ELICIT consists of two steps: the rank ordering of 
      evaluation criteria based on decision-makers' (DMs) preferences using the 
      principal component analysis; and the estimation of criteria weights and their 
      descriptive statistics using the variable interdependent analysis and the Monte 
      Carlo method. The application of ELICIT is illustrated with a hypothetical case 
      study involving the elicitation of weights for five criteria used to select the 
      best device for eye surgery. RESULTS: The criteria were ranked from 1-5, based on 
      a strict preference relationship established by the DMs. For each criterion, the 
      deterministic weight was estimated as well as the standard deviation and 95% 
      credibility interval. CONCLUSIONS: ELICIT is appropriate in situations where only 
      ordinal DMs' preferences are available to elicit decision criteria weights.

TI  - Regional risk assessment for contaminated sites part 1: vulnerability assessment 
      by multicriteria decision analysis.
PG  - 1295-306
LID - 10.1016/j.envint.2011.05.005 [doi]
AB  - As highlighted in the EU Soil Communication, local contamination is one of the 
      main soil threats and it is often related to present and past industrial 
      activities which left a legacy of a high number of contaminated sites in Europe. 
      These contaminated sites can be harmful to many different receptors according to 
      their sensitivity/susceptibility to contamination, and specific vulnerability 
      evaluations are needed in order to manage this widely spread environmental issue. 
      In this paper a novel comprehensive vulnerability assessment framework to assess 
      regional receptor susceptibility to contaminated site is presented. The developed 
      methodology, which combines multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques 
      and spatial analysis, can be applied to different receptors recognized as 
      relevant for regional assessment. In order to characterize each receptor, picked 
      parameters significant for the estimation of the vulnerability to contaminated 
      sites have been selected, normalized and aggregated by means of multi criteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The developed MCDA methodology, based on the 
      Choquet integral, allows to include expert judgments for the elicitation of 
      synergic and conflicting effects between involved criteria and is applied to all 
      the geographical objects representing the identified receptors. To test the 
      potential of the vulnerability methodology, it has been applied to a specific 
      case study area in the upper Silesia region of Poland where it proved to be 
      reliable and consistent with the environmental experts' expected results. The 
      vulnerability assessment results indicate that groundwater is the most vulnerable 
      receptor characterized by a wide area with vulnerability scores belonging to the 
      highest vulnerability class. As far as the other receptors are concerned, human 
      health and surface water are characterized by quite homogeneous vulnerability 
      scores falling in the medium-high vulnerability classes, while protected areas 
      resulted to be the less vulnerable receptor with only one protected area falling 
      in the medium vulnerability class. The vulnerability assessment results will 
      support the regional risk assessment for the ranking of potentially contaminated 
      sites at regional scale.

TI  - Optimization-based multicriteria decision analysis for identification of desired 
      petroleum-contaminated groundwater remediation strategies.
PG  - 9505-14
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-4081-y [doi]
AB  - The conventional multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods used for 
      pollution control generally depend on the data currently available. This could 
      limit their real-world applications, especially where the input data (e.g., the 
      most cost-effective remediation cost and eventual contaminant concentration) 
      might vary by scenario. This study proposes an optimization-based MCDA (OMCDA) 
      framework to address such a challenge. It is capable of (1) capturing various 
      preferences of decision-makers, (2) screening and analyzing the performance of 
      various optimized remediation strategies under changeable scenarios, and (3) 
      compromising incongruous decision analysis results. A real-world case study is 
      employed for demonstration, where four scenarios are considered with each one 
      corresponding to a set of weights representative of the preference of the 
      decision-makers. Four criteria are selected, i.e., optimal total pumping rate, 
      remediation cost, contaminant concentration, and fitting error. Their values are 
      determined through running optimization and optimization-based simulation 
      procedures. Four sets of the most desired groundwater remediation strategies are 
      identified, implying specific pumping rates under varied scenarios. Results 
      indicate that the best action lies in groups 32 and 16 for the 5-year, groups 49 
      and 36 for the 10-year, groups 26 and 13 for the 15-year, and groups 47 and 13 
      for the 20-year remediation.

      landslide susceptibility mapping for the prediction of future hazards, land use 
      planning, as well as for hazard preparedness. However, the uncertainties 
      associated with MCDA techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to 
      multiple types of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to 
      uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We access the uncertainty of landslide 
      susceptibility maps produced with GIS-MCDA techniques. A new spatially-explicit 
      approach and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) are employed to assess the 
      uncertainties associated with two MCDA techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchical 
      Process (AHP) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) implemented in GIS. The 
      methodology is composed of three different phases. First, weights are computed to 
      express the relative importance of factors (criteria) for landslide 
      susceptibility. Next, the uncertainty and sensitivity of landslide susceptibility 
      is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo Simulation and Global 
      Sensitivity Analysis. Finally, the results are validated using a landslide 
      inventory database and by applying DST. The comparisons of the obtained landslide 
      susceptibility maps of both MCDA techniques with known landslides show that the 
      AHP outperforms OWA. However, the OWA-generated landslide susceptibility map 
      shows lower uncertainty than the AHP-generated map. The results demonstrate that 
      further improvement in the accuracy of GIS-based MCDA can be achieved by 
      employing an integrated uncertainty-sensitivity analysis approach, in which the 
      uncertainty of landslide susceptibility model is decomposed and attributed to 
      model's criteria weights.

AB  - Aim: In this article, we aim to present a tool for the early assessment of 
      medical technologies. This evaluation system was designed and implemented by the 
      National Centre for HTA and the National Centre for Innovative Technologies of 
      the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Italy, in order to respond to an institutional 
      commitment within the "Health Technologies Assessment Team" that was established 
      to face the huge demand for the evaluation of Health Technologies during the 
      pandemic event caused by COVID-19, with a smart and easy-to-use framework. 
      Methods: Horizon scanning was conducted through a brief assessment carried out 
      according to the multicriteria decision analysis methodology. Each HTA domain was 
      attributed a score according to a pros/cons and opportunities/threats system, 
      derived from evidence in the literature. Scores were weighted according to 
      different perspectives. Scores were presented in a Cartesian graph showing the 
      positioning according to the potential value and the perceived risk associated 
      with the technology. Results: Two case studies regarding the early assessment 
      were reported, concerning two specific technologies: an individual protection 
      device and a contact tracking system.

TI  - Collaborative environmental planning in river management: an application of 
      multicriteria decision analysis in the White River Watershed in Vermont.
PG  - 534-46
AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides a well-established family of 
      decision tools to aid stakeholder groups in arriving at collective decisions. 
      MCDA can also function as a framework for the social learning process, serving as 
      an educational aid in decision problems characterized by a high level of public 
      participation. In this paper, the framework and results of a structured decision 
      process using the outranking MCDA methodology preference ranking organization 
      method of enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) are presented. PROMETHEE is used to 
      frame multi-stakeholder discussions of river management alternatives for the 
      Upper White River of Central Vermont, in the northeastern United States. 
      Stakeholders met over 10 months to create a shared vision of an ideal river and 
      its services to communities, develop a list of criteria by which to evaluate 
      river management alternatives, and elicit preferences to rank and compare 
      individual and group preferences. The MCDA procedure helped to frame a group 
      process that made stakeholder preferences explicit and substantive discussions 
      about long-term river management possible.

AB  - Risk maps are one of several sources used to inform risk-based disease 
      surveillance and control systems, but their production can be hampered by lack of 
      access to suitable disease data. In such situations, knowledge-driven spatial 
      modeling methods are an alternative to data-driven approaches. This study used 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to identify areas in Asia suitable for the 
      occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in domestic 
      poultry. Areas most suitable for H5N1 occurrence included Bangladesh, the 
      southern tip and eastern coast of Vietnam, parts of north-central Thailand and 
      large parts of eastern China. The predictive accuracy of the final model, as 
      determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC 
      AUC), was 0.670 (95% CI 0.667-0.673) suggesting that, in data-scarce 
      environments, MCDA provides a reasonable alternative to the data-driven 
      approaches usually used to inform risk-based disease surveillance and control 
      strategies.

AB  - Identifying suitable zones for surface water storage and groundwater recharge is 
      needed to enhance irrigation water availability. This study was undertaken to map 
      rainwater harvesting (RWH) potential zones using geospatial tools and analytic 
      hierarchy process (AHP). The suitable locations for RWH were also mapped using 
      the Boolean logic concept. The surface runoff is a vital factor to demarcate the 
      appropriate zones for RWH. The curve number approach was used to estimate the 
      surface runoff potential. The runoff coefficient (RC) map was generated based on 
      rainfall and surface runoff depth. Weights have been allocated to selected themes 
      of RC, drainage density, and slope. The themes were integrated using geographic 
      information system (GIS) and AHP to demarcate the suitable zones for RWH. The 
      derived RWH potential map was categorized into zones like "very good," "good," 
      "moderate," "poor," and "very poor" with an aerial extent of 14.3%, 24.7%, 28.3%, 
      20.2%, and 12.6%, respectively. The area suitable for farm ponds was found to be 
      about 9% (408 km(2)), 13% (329 km(2)), and 4% (244 km(2)) in Mirzapur, Chandauli, 
      and Sonbhadra districts, respectively. Furthermore, 22, 15, and 21 locations were 
      found suitable for check dams in Mirzapur, Chandauli, and Sonbhadra districts, 
      respectively. At a large scale, effective planning of water management strategies 
      based on multicriteria decision analysis and GIS offers increased availability of 
      surface and groundwater resources and may help for enhancing the agricultural 
      land use options. The higher resolution maps may be further utilized to plan RWH 
      strategies at village level.

AB  - PURPOSE: Risk-stratified screening has potential to improve the cost 
      effectiveness of national breast cancer screening programs. This study aimed to 
      inform a socially acceptable and equitable implementation framework by 
      determining what influences a woman's decision to accept a personalized breast 
      cancer risk assessment and what the relative impact of these key determinants is. 
      METHODS: Multicriteria decision analysis was used to elicit the relative weights 
      for 8 criteria that women reported influenced their decision. Preference 
      heterogeneity was explored through cluster analysis. RESULTS: The 2 criteria 
      valued most by the 347 participants related to program access, "Mode of 
      invitation" and "Testing process". Both criteria significantly influenced 
      participation (P < .001). A total of 73% preferred communication by 
      letter/online. Almost all women preferred a multidisease risk assessment with 
      potential for a familial high-risk result. Four preference-based subgroups were 
      identified. Membership to the largest subgroup was predicted by lower educational 
      attainment, and women in this subgroup were concerned with program access. Higher 
      relative perceived breast cancer risk predicted membership to the smallest 
      subgroup that was focused on test parameters, namely "Scope of test" and "Test 
      specificity". CONCLUSION: Overall, Australian women would accept a personalized 
      multidisease risk assessment, but when aligning with their preferences, it will 
      necessitate a focus on program access and the development of online communication 
      frameworks.

TI  - The Cost-effective Laboratory: Implementation of Economic Evaluation of 
      Laboratory Testing.
PG  - 238-242

AB  - Laboratory testing as a part of laboratory in vitro diagnostic (IVD) has become 
      required tool in clinical practice for diagnosing, monitoring and prognosis of 
      diseases, as well as for prediction of treatment response. The number of IVD 
      tests available in laboratory practice has increased over the past decades and is 
      likely to further increase in the future. Consequently, there is growing concern 
      about the overutilization of laboratory tests and rising costs for laboratory 
      testing. It is estimated that IVD accounts for between 1.4 and 2.3% of total 
      healthcare expenditure and less than 5% of total hospital cost (Lewin Group 
      report). These costs are rather low when compared to pharmaceuticals and medical 
      aids which account for 15 and 5%, respectively. On the other hand, IVD tests play 
      an important role in clinical practice, as they influence from 60% to 70% of 
      clinical decision-making. Unfortunately, constant increases in healthcare 
      spending are not directly related to healthcare benefit. Since healthcare 
      resources are limited, health payers are interested whether the benefits of IVD 
      tests are actually worth their cost. Many articles have introduced frameworks to 
      assess the economic value of IVD tests. The most appropriate tool for 
      quantitative assessment of their economic value is cost-effectiveness (CEA) and 
      cost-utility (CUA) analysis. The both analysis determine cost in terms of 
      effectiveness or utilities (combine quantity and quality of life) of new 
      laboratory test against its alternative. On the other hand, some investigators 
      recommended calculation of laboratory test value as product of two ratios: 
      Laboratory test value = (Technical accuracy/Turnaround time) × (Utility/Costs). 
      Recently, some researches used multicriteria decision analysis which allows 
      comparison of diagnostic strategies in terms of benefits, opportunities, costs 
      and risks. All analyses are constructed to identify laboratory test that produce 
      the greatest healthcare benefit with the resources available. Without solid 
      evidence that certain laboratory tests are cost-effective, laboratory services 
      cannot be improved. Consequently, simple policy measures such as cost cutting may 
      be imposed upon many laboratories while patients will have limited access to 
      laboratory service.

AB  - Current nanomaterial research is focused on the medical applications of 
      nanotechnology, whereas side effects associated with nanotechnology use, 
      especially the environmental impacts, are not taken into consideration during the 
      engineering process. Nanomedical users and developers are faced with the 
      challenge of balancing the medical and societal benefits and risks associated 
      with nanotechnology. The adequacy of available tools, such as 
      physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling or predictive structure-activity 
      relationships, in assessing the toxicity and risk associated with specific 
      nanomaterials is unknown. Successful development of future nanomedical devices 
      and pharmaceuticals thus requires a consolidated information base to select the 
      optimal nanomaterial in a given situation--understanding the toxicology and 
      potential side effects associated with candidate materials for medical 
      applications, understanding product life cycle, and communicating effectively 
      with personnel, stakeholders, and regulators. This can be achieved through an 
      innovative combination of toxicology, risk assessment modeling, and tools 
      developed in the field of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been suggested by some 
      researchers as a method to capture the benefits beyond quality adjusted 
      life-years in a transparent and consistent manner. The objectives of this article 
      were to analyze the possible application of MCDA approaches in health technology 
      assessment and to describe their relative advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: 
      This article begins with an introduction to the most common types of MCDA models 
      and a critical review of state-of-the-art methods for incorporating multiple 
      criteria in health technology assessment. An overview of MCDA is provided and is 
      compared against the current UK National Institute for Health and Clinical 
      Excellence health technology appraisal process. A generic MCDA modeling approach 
      is described, and the different MCDA modeling approaches are applied to a 
      hypothetical case study. RESULTS: A comparison of the different MCDA approaches 
      is provided, and the generic issues that need consideration before the 
      application of MCDA in health technology assessment are examined. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There are general practical issues that might arise from using an MCDA approach, 
      and it is suggested that appropriate care be taken to ensure the success of MCDA 
      techniques in the appraisal process.

TI  - Automated ischemic beat classification using genetic algorithms and multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 1717-25
AB  - Cardiac beat classification is a key process in the detection of myocardial 
      ischemic episodes in the electrocardiographic signal. In the present study, we 
      propose a multicriteria sorting method for classifying the cardiac beats as 
      ischemic or not. Through a supervised learning procedure, each beat is compared 
      to preclassified category prototypes under five criteria. These criteria refer to 
      ST segment changes, T wave alterations, and the patient's age. The difficulty in 
      applying the above criteria is the determination of the required method 
      parameters, namely the thresholds and weight values. To overcome this problem, we 
      employed a genetic algorithm, which, after proper training, automatically 
      calculates the optimum values for the above parameters. A task-specific cardiac 
      beat database was developed for training and testing the proposed method using 
      data from the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database. Various experimental 
      tests were carried out in order to adjust each module of the classification 
      system. The obtained performance was 91% in terms of both sensitivity and 
      specificity and compares favorably to other beat classification approaches 
      proposed in the literature.

AB  - The aim was to provide global experts ranking on priorities in diagnostic tools 
      for VAP in clinical practice. A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was 
      performed to identify diagnosis tools for VAP diagnosis. Priority factors were 
      identified after literature review. An international, multidisciplinary expert 
      panel reviewed variables and ranked diagnostic tools. Experts from ten European 
      hospitals participated. Regarding bedside clinical practices, seven required 
      chest X-ray use in all patients, whereas six reported the use of blood cultures 
      and endotracheal aspirate in all patients. Invasive techniques were routinely 
      performed in seven sites. CRP, PCT, and Gram stains were performed in all 
      patients by 5, 2, and 8, respectively. Impact on patient outcomes, safety, and 
      impact on the decision to start antibiotic therapy were ranked as the top three 
      relevant concerns (7.7/10, 7/10, and 6.9/10, respectively). Chest X-ray was 
      ranked as the most important imaging technique to diagnose VAP (score 251.7). 
      Apart from blood cultures, endotracheal aspirate culture was identified as the 
      main collection method for the microbiological testing (scores of 274.8 and 
      246.8, respectively). Mini-BAL was the preferred invasive technique with a score 
      of 208. Top three biomarkers were CRP (score 184.3), PCT (181.3), and WBC 
      (166.4). Gram stain (192.5) was prioritized among laboratory diagnostic 
      techniques. Using MCDA, it is recommended to perform a combination of diagnostic 
      techniques including images (chest X-ray), culture of clinical specimens (blood 
      cultures and endotracheal aspirate), and biomarkers (CRP or PCT) for VAP 
      diagnosis at the bedside. Gram stain was ranked as the preferred laboratory 
      technique.

TI  - Which drugs are best for overactive bladder? From patients' expectations to 
      physicians' decisions.
PG  - e13870
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.13870 [doi]
LID - e13870
AB  - AIM: In order to help physicians determine which drugs are the best for treating 
      overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, this review considered three questions: what 
      are the patient's expectations? What information is generated by the 
      Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model? What can physicians expect from 
      medical treatments? METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken on 
      these three topics in order to assist physicians regarding the optimum treatment 
      modality for OAB. RESULTS: Patients' difficulties in reporting symptoms and their 
      expectations of treatment outcomes interfere with the success of treatment. To 
      assist physicians in meeting patients' expectations and to choose the most 
      appropriate treatment, a new approach, recognised by the European Medicines 
      Agency, the MCDA model was used to compare the benefits and safety of OAB 
      treatments. CONCLUSION: The MCDA model is useful for comparing the benefit-safety 
      profiles of OAB drugs in order to equip clinicians with information on the drug 
      that might best meet their patient's needs. Flexibly dosed fesoterodine appeared 
      to be most efficacious in resolving urgency and urgency incontinence compared 
      with other drugs, and resolution of urinary urgency appears to be associated with 
      a reduced number of reported adverse events.

TI  - Applying Decision Science to the Prioritization of Healthcare-Associated 
      Infection Initiatives.
PG  - 506-512
LID - 10.1097/PTS.0000000000000416 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Improving patient quality remains a top priority from the 
      perspectives of both patient outcomes and cost of care. The continuing threat to 
      patient safety has resulted in an increasing number of options for patient safety 
      initiatives, making choices more difficult because of competing priorities. This 
      study provides a proof of concept for using low-cost decision science methods for 
      prioritizing initiatives. METHODS: Using multicriteria decision analysis, we 
      developed a decision support model for aiding the prioritization of the four most 
      common types of healthcare-associated infections: surgical site infections, 
      central line-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated events, and 
      catheter-associated urinary tract infections. In semistructured interviews, we 
      elicited structure and parameter values of a candidate model, which was then 
      validated by six participants with different roles across three urban teaching 
      and nonteaching hospitals in the Baltimore, Maryland area. RESULTS: Participants 
      articulated the following structural attributes of concern: patient harm, 
      monetary costs, patient mortality, reputational effects, and patient 
      satisfaction. A quantitative decision-making model with an associated uncertainty 
      report for prioritizing initiatives related to the four most common types of 
      healthcare-associated infections was then created. CONCLUSIONS: A decision 
      support methodology such as our proof of concept could aid hospital executives in 
      prioritizing the quality improvement initiatives within their hospital, with more 
      complete data. Because hospitals continue to struggle in improving quality of 
      care with tighter budgets, a formal decision support mechanism could be used to 
      objectively prioritize patient safety and quality initiatives.

TI  - Methods and criteria for the assessment of orphan drugs: a scoping review.
PG  - e59
LID - 10.1017/S0266462322000393 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify different criteria for priority setting 
      of rare diseases to help policy makers in making evidence-informed decisions. 
      METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to comprehensively examine the existing 
      various methods and criteria for prioritizing orphan drugs and rare diseases. We 
      performed searching in Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and websites of health technology 
      assessment (HTA) agencies, 2000-21, and data were extracted. RESULTS: From the 
      1,580 identified publications, eleven articles were included. Multicriteria 
      decision analysis was the most frequent method (seven out of eleven studies) used 
      for priority setting. The extracted criteria for priority setting of orphan 
      products were analyzed based on six main categories as follows: health outcomes 
      and clinical implications (six subsets which showed clinical implications), 
      economic aspects (four subsets that indicated the economic effects of orphan 
      drugs and rare diseases), disease and population characteristics (six subsets 
      that included the characteristics of the rare diseases), therapeutic alternatives 
      and uniqueness of orphan technologies (two subsets which discussed the 
      alternatives and uniqueness of orphan technologies), evidence (three subsets 
      which regarded the quality and availability of evidence), and other criteria 
      (three subsets dealing with social and organizational criteria). 
      Cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and disease severity were the most frequent 
      criteria in the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high price of orphan drugs 
      and limitations of using HTA for reimbursement of them, it is critical to explore 
      them by precise technical methods like multiple criteria decision making in 
      priority setting.

TI  - Choosing a sustainable demolition waste management strategy using multicriteria 
      decision analysis.
PG  - 12-20
LID - 10.1016/j.wasman.2008.04.010 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents an application of the ELECTRE III decision-aid method in the 
      context of choosing a sustainable demolition waste management strategy for a case 
      study in the city of Lyon, France. This choice of waste management strategy takes 
      into consideration the sustainable development objectives, i.e. economic aspects, 
      environmental consequences, and social issues. Nine alternatives for demolition 
      waste management were compared with the aid of eight criteria, taking into 
      account energy consumption, depletion of abiotic resources, global warming, 
      dispersion of dangerous substances in the environment, economic activity, 
      employment, and quality of life of the local population. The case study concerned 
      the demolition of 25 buildings of an old military camp. Each alternative was 
      illustrated with different waste treatments, such as material recovery, 
      recycling, landfilling, and energy recovery. The recommended solution for 
      sustainable demolition waste management for the case study is a selective 
      deconstruction of each building with local material recovery in road engineering 
      of inert wastes, local energy recovery of wood wastes, and specific treatments 
      for hazardous wastes.

TI  - An integrated study of spatial multicriteria analysis and mathematical modelling 
      for managed aquifer recharge site suitability mapping and site ranking at 
      Northern Gaza coastal aquifer.

LID - S0301-4797(13)00187-4 [pii]

AB  - This paper describes an integrated approach of site suitability mapping and 
      ranking of the most suitable sites, for the implementation of Managed Aquifer 
      Recharge (MAR) projects, using spatial multicriteria decision analysis (SMCDA) 
      techniques and mathematical modelling. The SMCDA procedure contains constraint 
      mapping, site suitability analysis with criteria standardization and weighting, 
      criteria overlay by analytical hierarchy process (AHP) combined with weighted 
      linear combination (WLC) and ordered weighted averaging (OWA), and sensitivity 
      analysis. The hydrogeological impacts of the selected most suitable sites were 
      quantified by using groundwater flow and transport modelling techniques. Finally, 
      ranking of the selected sites was done with the WLC method. The integrated 
      approach is demonstrated by a case study in the coastal aquifer of North Gaza. 
      Constraint mapping shows that 50% of the total study area is suitable for MAR 
      implementation. About 25% of the total area is "very good" and 25% percent is 
      "good" for MAR, according to the site suitability analysis. Six locations were 
      selected and ranked against six representative decision criteria. Long term (year 
      2003 to year 2040) groundwater flow and transport simulations were performed to 
      quantify the selected criteria under MAR project operation conditions at the 
      selected sites. Finally, the suitability mapping and hydrogeological 
      investigation recommends that the location of the existing infiltration ponds, 
      constructed near the planned North Gaza Wastewater Treatment Plant (NGWWTP) is 
      most suitable for MAR project implementation. This paper concludes that 
      mathematical modelling should be combined with the SMCDA technique in order to 
      select the best location for MAR project implementation. Besides MAR project 
      implementation, the generalised approach can be applicable for any other water 
      resources development project that deals with site selection and implementation.

TI  - Approaches to economic evaluations of stroke rehabilitation.
PG  - 88-100
LID - 10.1111/ijs.12041 [doi]
AB  - Many stroke rehabilitation services and interventions are complex in that they 
      involve a number of components, interactions, and outcomes. Much of the onus of 
      stroke care lies with rehabilitation services and because stroke rehabilitation 
      is highly resource intensive, it is important for policy makers to consider the 
      potential trade-offs between all relevant costs and benefits. The primary aim of 
      this systematic review was to assess the methods used to conduct economic 
      evaluations of stroke rehabilitation. Studies that compared two or more 
      alternative stroke rehabilitation interventions or services with the costs and 
      outcomes being examined for each alternative were included. EMBASE, MEDLINE 
      In-Process, and National Health Service's Economic Evaluation Database were 
      searched using search strategies. The methodological quality of the included 
      studies was appraised using a checklist for the conduct and reporting of economic 
      evaluations. Twenty-one studies met the selection criteria. The economic 
      evaluations in the majority of these studies were inadequate based on their 
      ability to identify, measure, and value all resources and benefits pertinent to 
      the complexity of stroke rehabilitation. This study highlights that complex 
      interventions such as stroke rehabilitation have widespread effects, which may 
      not be represented by the changes on a single outcome. This study recommends the 
      adoption of a wider cost and benefit perspective in the economic evaluations of 
      complex interventions. It supports a move away from conventional economic 
      evaluation and decision making, based purely on cost-effectiveness, toward 
      multicriteria decision analysis frameworks for complex interventions, where a 
      broader range of criteria may be assessed by policy makers.

TI  - Combining In Silico Tools with Multicriteria Analysis for Alternatives Assessment 
      of Hazardous Chemicals: Accounting for the Transformation Products of decaBDE and 
      Its Alternatives.
PG  - 1088-1098
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c02593 [doi]
AB  - Transformation products ought to be an important consideration in chemical 
      alternatives assessment. In this study, a recently established hazard ranking 
      tool for alternatives assessment based on in silico data and multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) methods was further developed to include chemical 
      transformation products. Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE) and five proposed 
      alternatives were selected as case chemicals; biotic and abiotic transformation 
      reactions were considered using five in silico tools. A workflow was developed to 
      select transformation products with the highest occurrence potential. The most 
      probable transformation products of the alternative chemicals were often 
      similarly persistent but more mobile in aquatic environments, which implies an 
      increasing exposure potential. When persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B), 
      mobility in the aquatic environment (M), and toxicity (T) are considered (via 
      PBT, PMT, or PBMT composite scoring), all six flame retardants have at least one 
      transformation product that can be considered more hazardous, across diverse 
      MCDA. Even when considering transformation products, the considered alternatives 
      remain less hazardous than decaBDE, though the range of hazard of the five 
      alternatives was reduced. The least hazardous of the considered alternatives were 
      melamine and bis(2-ethylhexyl)-tetrabromophthalate. This developed tool could be 
      integrated within holistic alternatives assessments considering use and life 
      cycle impacts or additionally prioritizing transformation products within 
      (bio)monitoring screening studies.

TI  - Incorporating MCDA into HTA: challenges and potential solutions, with a focus on 
      lower income settings.
PG  - 43

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has the potential to bring 
      more structure and transparency to health technology assessment (HTA). The 
      objective of this paper is to highlight key methodological and practical 
      challenges facing the use of MCDA for HTA, with a particular focus on lower and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs), and to highlight potential solutions to these 
      challenges. METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES: Key lessons from existing applications of 
      MCDA to HTA are summarized, including: that the socio-technical design of the 
      MCDA reflect the local decision problem; the criteria set properties of additive 
      models are understood and applied; and the alternative approaches for estimating 
      opportunity cost, and the challenges with these approaches are understood. 
      PRACTICAL CHALLENGES: Existing efforts to implement HTA in LMICs suggest a number 
      of lessons that can help overcome the practical challenges facing the 
      implementation of MCDA in LMICs, including: adapting inputs from other settings 
      and from expert opinion; investing in technical capacity; embedding the MCDA in 
      the decision-making process; and ensuring that the MCDA design reflects local 
      cultural and social factors. CONCLUSION: MCDA has the potential to improve 
      decision making in LMICs. For this potential to be achieved, it is important that 
      the lessons from existing applications of MCDA are learned.

TI  - MCDA or preference-based social welfare functions?
PG  - 41
LID - 10.1186/s12962-018-0122-y [doi]
LID - 41
AB  - Preference-based social welfare functions (pbSWF) perform better at reconciling 
      competing personal and social goals than typical forms of MCDA. Its virtues are 
      (a) its respect for people's own judgments about the relative values of health, 
      wealth, and other broad benefits within their lives (non-paternalism) and (b) its 
      conformity with reasonable ethical axioms. Any discrepancy between an MCDA 
      objective function and that implied by pbSWF suggests the former's failure to 
      respect non-paternalism and reasonable ethical principles. The pbSWF approach is 
      implementable using micro-econometric evidence on personal preferences over 
      health, wealth, and other broad benefits; and surveys of the general population 
      or their representatives to ascertain the social acceptability of certain ethical 
      axioms and the degree of inequality aversion.

TI  - Use of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for decision-making policies-what 
      is the problem? A perspective paper.
PG  - 913-918
LID - 10.1080/14737167.2022.2064847 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug reimbursement decisions that spark public controversy are 
      potential signals that processes used to reach such decisions do not adequately 
      reflect society's goals. Such controversial decisions appear to be a 
      characteristic of Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)-based Incremental Cost 
      Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)-dominated decision-making systems. QALY-based 
      ICER-heavy systems have several known weaknesses that lead to individual and 
      societal preferences being either ignored or considered in an unsystematic and 
      inconsistent manner. AREAS COVERED: We reprise some of the key inadequacies of 
      QALY-based ICER analyses and suggest that there are other means including 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and cost-benefit analysis based on 
      willingness to pay (WTP) measures by which to partially mitigate these 
      weaknesses. EXPERT OPINION: For long, the inadequacies of QALY-based ICER-heavy 
      decision-making systems have been rationalized with the answer: 'while the method 
      is a second best, it is the best we currently have.' In light of the equally 
      well-developed and widely utilized alternatives available, this resistance to 
      improve assessment processes should not be accepted by policy makers. Health 
      technology assessment bodies should consider and, with appropriate modifications, 
      adopt these alternatives as they have the potential to result in more 
      comprehensive, systematic, and accountable decision-making.

TI  - Use and Misuse of MCDA to Support Decision Making Informed by Risk.
PG  - 1513-1521
LID - 10.1111/risa.13631 [doi]
AB  - Recent guidelines for risk-informed decision making (RIDM) provide a 
      gold-standard for how to incorporate probabilistic risk models in conjunction 
      with other considerations in a decision process. Nevertheless, risk 
      quantification using probabilistic and statistical methods is difficult in 
      situations where threat, vulnerability, and consequences are highly uncertain and 
      risk quantification. In such situations a wider variety of methods could be 
      employed, which we call decision making informed by risk (DMIR) combining risk 
      and decision analytics. Risk informed decision making (RIDM) can be considered as 
      a special case of DMIR. Multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) often serves as a 
      basis for DMIR in order to flexibly accommodate different levels of analytical 
      detail. DMIR often involves artful use of proxy variables that correlate with, 
      and are more measurable than, underlying factors of interest. This article 
      introduces the notion of DMIR and discusses the use of MCDA in its application in 
      the context of risk-based problems. MCDA-based risk analyses identify metrics 
      associated with threats of concern and system vulnerabilities, characterize the 
      way in which alternative actions can affect these threats and vulnerabilities, 
      and ultimately synthesize this information to compare, prioritize, or select 
      alternative mitigation strategies. Simple linear additive MCDA models often 
      integrate these inputs, but the same simplicity can limit such approaches and 
      create pitfalls and more advanced models including multiplicative relationships 
      can be warranted. This essay qualitatively explores the critical practitioner 
      questions of how and when the use of linear multicriteria models creates 
      significant problems, and how to avoid them.

TI  - Personalizing Second-Line Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Selection: Combining Network 
      Meta-analysis, Individualized Risk, and Patient Preferences for Unified Decision 
      Support.
PG  - 239-252
LID - 10.1177/0272989X19829735 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Personalizing medical treatment often requires practitioners to 
      compare multiple treatment options, assess a patient's unique risk and benefit 
      from each option, and elicit a patient's preferences around treatment. We 
      integrated these 3 considerations into a decision-modeling framework for the 
      selection of second-line glycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Based on 
      multicriteria decision analysis, we developed a unified treatment decision 
      support tool accounting for 3 factors: patient preferences, disease outcomes, and 
      medication efficacy and safety profiles. By standardizing and multiplying these 3 
      factors, we calculated the ranking score for each medication. This approach was 
      applied to determining second-line glycemic therapy by integrating 1) treatment 
      efficacy and side-effect data from a network meta-analysis of 301 randomized 
      trials ( N = 219,277), 2) validated risk equations for type 2 diabetes 
      complications, and 3) patient preferences around treatment (e.g., to avoid daily 
      glucose testing). Data from participants with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2014, N = 1107) 
      were used to explore variations in treatment recommendations and associated 
      quality-adjusted life-years given different patient features. RESULTS: Patients 
      at the highest microvascular disease risk had glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists or 
      basal insulin recommended as top choices, whereas those wanting to avoid an 
      injected medication or daily glucose testing had sodium-glucose linked 
      transporter 2 or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors commonly recommended, and 
      those with major cost concerns had sulfonylureas commonly recommended. By 
      converting from the most common sulfonylurea treatment to the model-recommended 
      treatment, NHANES participants were expected to save an average of 0.036 
      quality-adjusted life-years per person (about a half month) from 10 years of 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Models can help integrate meta-analytic treatment effect 
      estimates with individualized risk calculations and preferences, to aid 
      personalized treatment selection.

TI  - Applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Simple Scoring as an 
      Evidence-based HTA Methodology for Evaluating Off-Patent Pharmaceuticals (OPPs) 
      in Emerging Markets.
PG  - 1-6
LID - S2212-1099(17)30001-8 [pii]

AB  - Off-patent pharmaceuticals (OPPs) represent more than 60% of the pharmaceutical 
      market in many emerging countries, where they are frequently evaluated primarily 
      on cost rather than with health technology assessment. OPPs are assumed to be 
      identical to the originators. Branded and unbranded generic versions can, 
      however, vary from the originator in active pharmaceutical ingredients, dosage, 
      consistency formulation, excipients, manufacturing processes, and distribution, 
      for example. These variables can alter the efficacy and safety of the product, 
      negatively impacting both the anticipated cost savings and the population's 
      health. In addition, many health care systems lack the resources or expertise to 
      evaluate such products, and current assessment methods can be complex and 
      difficult to adapt to a health system's needs. Multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) simple scoring is an evidence-based health technology assessment 
      methodology for evaluating OPPs, especially in emerging countries in which 
      resources are limited but decision makers still must balance affordability with 
      factors such as drug safety, level interchangeability, manufacturing site and 
      active pharmaceutical ingredient quality, supply track record, and real-life 
      outcomes. MCDA simple scoring can be applied to pharmaceutical pricing, 
      reimbursement, formulary listing, and drug procurement. In November 2015, a 
      workshop was held at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes 
      Research Annual Meeting in Milan to refine and prioritize criteria that can be 
      used in MCDA simple scoring for OPPs, resulting in an example MCDA process and 22 
      prioritized criteria that health care systems in emerging countries can easily 
      adapt to their own decision-making processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining cardiovascular disease (CVD) research priorities is 
      essential given the high burden of these diseases, limited financial resources, 
      and competing priorities. This study aimed to determine the research priorities 
      in CVD field in Iran using standard indigenous methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 
      extensive search was done in relevant international and national studies. Then, 
      an indigenous standard multistage approach based on multicriteria decision 
      analysis steps was adapted to local situation and implemented. This process 
      included forming a working group of experts in priority setting methodology, 
      identifying the context and prioritization framework, discussing the methodology 
      with the National Network of CVD Research (NCVDR) members who ultimately 
      determined the priority research topics, weighted topics criteria, ranked topics, 
      and reviewed all determined research priorities for final report. RESULTS: 
      Thirteen cardiovascular research priorities were determined by the NCVDR members. 
      The first five priorities based on their scores include studies in hypertension, 
      prevention and control of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and its risk factors, 
      burden of IHD, Registration of CVDs, and COVID-19 and CVDs. CONCLUSION: 
      Cardiovascular research priorities were determined using a standard indigenous 
      approach by national experts who are the NCVDR members. These priorities can be 
      used by researchers and health decision makers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The predominant oncologist-led model in many countries is 
      unsustainable to meet the needs of a growing cohort of breast cancer survivors 
      (BCS). Despite available alternative models, adoption rates have been poor. To 
      help BCS navigate survivorship care, we aimed to systematically develop a 
      decision aid (DA) to guide their choice of follow-up care model and evaluate its 
      acceptability and usability among BCS and health care providers (HCPs). METHODS: 
      We recruited BCS aged ≥ 21 years who have completed primary treatment and 
      understand English. BCS receiving palliative care or with cognitive impairment 
      were excluded. HCPs who routinely discussed post-treatment care with BCS were 
      purposively sampled based on disciplines. Each participant reviewed the DA during 
      a semi-structured interview using the 'think aloud' approach and completed an 
      acceptability questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and directed content analysis 
      were used. RESULTS: We conducted three rounds of alpha testing with 15 BCS and 8 
      HCPs. All BCS found the final DA prototype easy to navigate with sufficient 
      interactivity. The information imbalance favouring the shared care option 
      perceived by 60% of BCS in early rounds was rectified. The length of DA was 
      optimized to be 'just right'. Key revisions made included (1) presenting care 
      options side-by-side to improve perceived information balance, (2) creating 
      dedicated sections explaining HCPs' care roles to address gaps in health system 
      contextual knowledge, and (3) employing a multicriteria decision analysis method 
      for preference clarification exercise to reflect the user's openness towards 
      shared care. Most BCS (73%) found the DA useful for decision-making, and 93% were 
      willing to discuss the DA with their HCPs. Most HCPs (88%) agreed that the DA was 
      a reliable tool and would be easily integrated into routine care. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our experience highlighted the need to provide contextual information on the 
      health care system for decisions related to care delivery. Developers should 
      address potential variability within the care model and clarify inherent biases, 
      such as low confidence levels in primary care. Future work could expand on the 
      developed DA's informational structure to apply to other care models and leverage 
      artificial intelligence to optimize information delivery.

TI  - A novel measure of drug benefit-risk assessment based on Scale Loss Score.
PG  - 2738-2753
LID - 10.1177/0962280218786526 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative methods have been proposed to assess and compare the benefit-risk 
      balance of treatments. Among them, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a 
      popular decision tool as it permits to summarise the benefits and the risks of a 
      drug in a single utility score, accounting for the preferences of the 
      decision-makers. However, the utility score is often derived using a linear model 
      which might lead to counter-intuitive conclusions; for example, drugs with no 
      benefit or extreme risk could be recommended. Moreover, it assumes that the 
      relative importance of benefits against risks is constant for all levels of 
      benefit or risk, which might not hold for all drugs. We propose Scale Loss Score 
      (SLoS) as a new tool for the benefit-risk assessment, which offers the same 
      advantages as the linear multicriteria decision analysis utility score but has, 
      in addition, desirable properties permitting to avoid recommendations of 
      non-effective or extremely unsafe treatments, and to tolerate larger increases in 
      risk for a given increase in benefit when the amount of benefit is small than 
      when it is high. We present an application to a real case study on telithromycin 
      in Community Acquired Pneumonia and Acute Bacterial Sinusitis, and we 
      investigated the patterns of behaviour of Scale Loss Score, as compared to the 
      linear multicriteria decision analysis, in a comprehensive simulation study.

AB  - Short-chain chlorinated paraffins are ones of the most recent chemical compounds 
      that have been classified as persistent organic pollutants. They have various 
      applications and are emitted to the environment. Despite the fact, that the 
      content levels of these compounds in the environmental compartments should be 
      monitored, there is still a lack of well-defined and validated analytical 
      procedures, proposed or suggested by the national or international environmental 
      protection agencies. Finding an appropriate analytical procedure (sensitive and 
      green at the same time) from many available ones is very often a difficult task. 
      Therefore it can be supported with multicriteria decision analysis. The dataset 
      consisting of 22 procedures was described by 7 criteria, mainly referring to 
      procedures greenness. The data treatment with cluster analysis and principal 
      component analysis revealed the internal structure of the dataset. Moreover, both 
      statistical tools allowed for reduction of dataset criteria to three. This was 
      used for applying ternary plot to show the multicriteria decision analysis 
      results within all possible weights. With the aid of chemometric and 
      multicriteria decision analysis tools it was easy to assess the set of analytical 
      procedure. Depending on the applied weights to assessment criteria different 
      analytical procedures are the most appropriate (winners).

TI  - Critical Systematic Review of Zoonoses and Transboundary Animal Diseases' 
      Prioritization in Africa.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens10080976 [doi]
LID - 976
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disease prioritization aims to enhance resource use efficiency 
      concerning human and animal health systems' preparedness and response to the most 
      important problems for the optimization of beneficial outcomes. In sub-Sahara 
      Africa (SSA), several prioritizations of zoonoses and transboundary animal 
      diseases (TADs) have been implemented at different scales to characterize 
      potential disease impacts. Method and principal findings: In this systematic 
      review, we analyze the methodologies used, outcomes, and their relevance by 
      discussing criteria required to align decision-makers' perceptions of impacts to 
      those of other stakeholders for different prioritization in SSA. In general, the 
      sectorial representativeness of stakeholders for processes implemented with the 
      support of international partners showed slight differences with the absence of 
      local stakeholders. Whatever the tool prioritized, zoonoses were similar in 
      general because of the structured nature of those tools in assessing 
      decision-makers' preferences through value trade-offs between criteria while 
      ensuring transparency and reproducibility. However, by involving field 
      practitioners and farmers, there were different outcomes with processes 
      concerning only decision makers and experts who were more sensitive to infectious 
      TADs, while the former raised parasitic disease constraints. In this context, 
      multicriteria decision analysis-based zoonoses and TADs prioritizations involving 
      a balanced participation of stakeholders might contribute to bridging these 
      divergences, whatever the scale. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Prioritization 
      processes were important steps toward building and harmonizing technical 
      laboratory and surveillance networks to coordinate projects to address priority 
      zoonoses and TADs at the country and/or sub-regional level. Those processes 
      should be enhanced.

PG  - 7503-7513
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-15911-1 [doi]
AB  - Contaminated site management is a multiple objective decision-making that 
      generally involves different factors, such as performance of technology, 
      environmental effects, cost, and social influence. In this study, we developed a 
      sustainability assessment-based methodology for the prioritization of 
      contaminated site risk management options. We integrate remediation sustainable 
      assessment and redevelopment sustainable assessment in one framework and allow 
      the optimization of indicators. The framework started with the definition of site 
      management type, then investigating site characterization, screening indicators, 
      quantifying of indicator, selecting assessment model, selecting primary options, 
      assessment with uncertainty analysis, and determining of preferred options. To 
      demonstrate the utility of the framework, results are presented in a contaminate 
      site in southwest China for two risk management decisions, site remediation and 
      site redevelopment. We used different approaches to evaluate the stability and 
      robustness of assessment results, including Monte Carlo simulation, scenario 
      analysis, and sensitivity analysis. The demonstration showed that attention has 
      to be paid to the proper description of the site, the principles of the 
      procedure, and the decision criteria.

PG  - 801-820
LID - 10.1177/0272989X211037946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids should help people make evidence-informed 
      decisions aligned with their values. There is limited guidance about how to 
      achieve such alignment. PURPOSE: To describe the range of values clarification 
      methods available to patient decision aid developers, synthesize evidence 
      regarding their relative merits, and foster collection of evidence by offering 
      researchers a proposed set of outcomes to report when evaluating the effects of 
      values clarification methods. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of 
      Science, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION: We included articles 
      that described randomized trials of 1 or more explicit values clarification 
      methods. From 30,648 records screened, we identified 33 articles describing 
      trials of 43 values clarification methods. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent 
      reviewers extracted details about each values clarification method and its 
      evaluation. DATA SYNTHESIS: Compared to control conditions or to implicit values 
      clarification methods, explicit values clarification methods decreased the 
      frequency of values-incongruent choices (risk difference, -0.04; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], -0.06 to -0.02; P < 0.001) and decisional conflict (standardized 
      mean difference, -0.20; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.11; P < 0.001). Multicriteria 
      decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values 
      clarification methods (χ(2) = 9.25, P = 0.01). There were no differences between 
      different values clarification methods regarding decisional conflict (χ(2) = 
      6.08, P = 0.05). LIMITATIONS: Some meta-analyses had high heterogeneity. We 
      grouped values clarification methods into broad categories. CONCLUSIONS: Current 
      evidence suggests patient decision aids should include an explicit values 
      clarification method. Developers may wish to specifically consider multicriteria 
      decision analysis. Future evaluations of values clarification methods should 
      report their effects on decisional conflict, decisions made, values congruence, 
      and decisional regret.

TI  - The decision analysis interview approach in the collaborative management of a 
      large regulated water course.
PG  - 1026-42
LID - 10.1007/s00267-008-9200-9 [doi]
AB  - There are always conflicting goals in the management of large water courses. 
      However, by involving stakeholders actively in the planning and decision-making 
      processes, it is possible to work together toward commonly acceptable solutions. 
      In this article, we describe how we applied interactive multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) in a collaborative process which aimed at an ecologically, 
      socially, and economically sustainable water course regulation policy. The 
      stakeholders' opinions about the alternative regulation schemes and the relative 
      importance of their impacts were elicited with the HIPRE software. Altogether, 20 
      personal interactive decision analysis interviews (DAIs) were carried out with 
      the stakeholders. Our experience suggests that the DAIs can considerably improve 
      the quality and efficiency of the collaborative planning process. By improving 
      communication and understanding of the decision situation in the steering group, 
      the approach helped to develop a consensus solution in a case having strong 
      conflicts of interest. In order to gain the full benefits of the MCDA approach, 
      interactive preference elicitation is vital. It is also essential to integrate 
      the approach tightly into the planning and decision-making process. The project's 
      home pages are available to the public at http://www.paijanne.hut.fi/.

TI  - The need to prioritize "prioritization" in clinical pharmacy service practice and 
      implementation.

AB  - Pharmacists are increasingly asked to incorporate new and greater amounts of 
      clinical services into their traditional medication distribution 
      responsibilities, but many barriers exist. Given the demanding pharmacy practice 
      environment, improved time management may improve implementation rates. One area 
      not previously explored within this area is the clinical skill of 
      "prioritization" of medication related problems (MRPs). Prioritization is vital 
      as the workload demand for pharmacist time exceeds time available; however, the 
      underdeveloped skills of prioritizing is a concern in the field of pharmacy 
      practice, as it also is across professions in healthcare. Previous research has 
      suggested that pharmacists and student pharmacists inexperienced in implementing 
      clinical services struggle knowing where to begin when providing direct patient 
      care, given the complex patient care regimens, a complex pharmacy practice 
      workload, and the numerous preventative care interventions possible for a given 
      patient. This paper provides a review of theory and science of prioritization in 
      patient care service delivery, including Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), 
      Lean Six Sigma (LSS), and Jaen's Competing Demands framework. A case study is 
      shared which emphasizes both the need for and potential impact of a renewed focus 
      on workload management skills, such as prioritization.

PG  - 25-32
LID - 10.1097/QMH.0000000000000193 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this article, we propose a method that integrates systematic 
      layout planning techniques to lean health care practices aided by multicriteria 
      decision analysis that could be applied to reformulate the layout of health care 
      facilities. METHODS: We analyze a high-variety sterilization unit of a large 
      public hospital located in Brazil. The unit is currently implementing lean 
      practices, and layout changes are required to provide more efficient materials 
      and information flows. RESULTS: Traditional design of health care facilities is 
      not aligned with lean implementation and its underlying practices and principles. 
      We propose the integration of such approaches to enhance their benefits. To rank 
      and select the best layout alternative, a multicriteria decision analysis method 
      (analytic hierarchy process) is adopted. CONCLUSIONS: There are 3 contributions 
      here: the integration of lean principles into traditional health care facility 
      design practices, the use of multicriteria decision analysis to refine the 
      determination of the best layout solution, and the application of our 
      propositions in a real case study.

TI  - A decision support system for territorial resilience assessment and planning: An

AB  - This paper aims to assess the territorial resilience of a socio-ecological system 
      through an innovative integrated evaluation framework to aid the decision-making 
      process in the planning of transformation scenarios. This framework employs a set 
      of resilience indicators through a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) coupled 
      with a Lotka-Volterra mathematical model of cooperative type. The set of 
      indicators aims to calculate a composite index of Territorial Resilience (TRI), 
      whereas the mathematical model is an extension of an existing model, aimed to 
      predict possible long-time scenarios. The proposed operational framework for 
      rural and vineyard landscapes aims to bridge the existing gap between territorial 
      resilience theory and practice, with an innovative Decision Support System able 
      to assist Decision Makers and territory planners in the planning and management 
      of resilient territorial systems. This integrated evaluation framework is applied 
      to a famous wine region in Portugal, the Douro Valley, where Port-wine grows. 
      Such framework, especially in a context of adaptive governance, proves to be a 
      suitable support in the field of landscape and urban planning to evaluate the 
      dynamics of socio-ecological systems and to envision long-term policies and 
      actions.

TI  - Facilitating the Decision-Making Process After a Nuclear Accident: Case Studies 
      in the Netherlands and Slovakia.
PG  - 376-387
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4375 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear accidents do not occur frequently, but their biological, psychosocial, 
      and/or economic consequences may be severe. Hence, a thorough preparation for 
      nuclear emergencies is needed to provide appropriate actions. During the 
      transition phase of an accident, it is vital to include stakeholders in the 
      decision-making process in order to gain support for the recovery strategy to be 
      implemented as well as to share different perspectives, knowledge, and views on 
      the decision problem. Because nuclear accidents are complex, involving many 
      relevant factors that range from technical aspects such as health effects and 
      costs to nontechnical issues such as social acceptance, a multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) may facilitate the decision-making process. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the usefulness of MCDA in the transition phase of a nuclear 
      accident. To this end, an MCDA tool, which uses the weighted sum of a set of 
      normalized criteria, was explored in exercises carried out in panel meetings with 
      a selected set of (largely) governmental stakeholders. The panel meetings were 
      performed in the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic. The exercises were based on 
      a fictitious case study that affected the urban environment of a small city. 
      Prior to the meetings, a set of 8 possible recovery strategies was identified. 
      The use of the MCDA tool showed that it facilitated the decision-making process 
      because it allowed for a structured and transparent approach in which 
      stakeholders with diverse backgrounds can express their opinions and perspectives 
      and reach consensus on the most appropriate recovery strategy. As such, it could 
      be applied to a broader field of research involving any chemical release that 
      necessitates an extended recovery strategy. Future research is needed in order to 
      incorporate psychosocial effects of a nuclear accident as well as a broader group 
      of stakeholders in exercises. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;17:376-387. © 2020

TI  - SMART Vaccines 2.0 decision-support platform: a tool to facilitate and promote 
      priority setting for sustainable vaccination in resource-limited settings.
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003587 [doi]
LID - e003587
AB  - In resource-constrained environments, priority setting is critical to making 
      sustainable decisions for introducing new and underused vaccines and choosing 
      among vaccine products. Donor organisations and national governments in 
      low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) recognise the need to support 
      prioritisation of vaccine decisions driven by local health system capacity, 
      epidemiology and financial sustainability.Successful efforts have supported the 
      establishment of National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) to 
      undertake evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) in LMICs. Now, attention is 
      increasingly focused on supporting their function to leverage local expertise and 
      priorities. EIDM and priority-setting functions are complex and dynamic 
      processes. Here, we report a pilot of a web-based decision-support tool. Applying 
      tenets of multicriteria decision analysis, SMART Vaccines 2.0 supported 
      transparent, reproducible and evidence-informed priority setting with an 
      easy-to-use interface and shareable outputs.The pilot was run by the Uganda NITAG 
      who were requested by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2016 to produce 
      recommendations on the prioritised introduction of five new vaccines. The tool 
      was acceptable to the NITAG and supported their recommendations to the MOH. The 
      tool highlighted sensitivity in the prioritisation process to the inherent biases 
      of different stakeholders. This feature also enabled examination of the 
      implications of data uncertainty. Feedback from users identified areas where the 
      tool could more explicitly support evidence-to-recommendation frameworks, 
      ultimately informing the next generation of the platform, PriorityVax.Country 
      ownership and priority setting in vaccine decisions are central to 
      sustainability. PriorityVax promotes auditable and rigorous deliberations; 
      enables and captures the decision matrix of users; and generates shareable 
      documentation of the process.

      however, do not address this issue. METHOD: Using a 2×2 factorial design, we 
      developed surveys that contained a decision scenario (involving a choice between 
      aspirin or a statin drug to lower risk of heart attack) and a decision aid. Each 
      aid presented identical information about reduction in heart attack risk and 
      likelihood of a major side effect. They differed in whether the options were 
      labeled and the amount of decisional guidance: information only (a balance sheet) 
      versus information plus values clarification (a multicriteria decision analysis). 
      We sent the surveys to members of 2 Internet survey panels. After using the 
      decision aid, participants indicated their preferred medication. Those using a 
      multicriteria decision aid also judged differences in the comparative outcome 
      data provided for the 2 options and the relative importance of achieving benefits 
      versus avoiding risks in making the decision. RESULTS: The study sample size was 
      536. Participants using decision aids with unlabeled options were more likely to 
      choose a statin: 56% versus 25% (P < 0.001). The type of decision aid made no 
      difference. This effect persisted after adjustment for differences in survey 
      company, age, gender, education level, health literacy, and numeracy. 
      Participants using unlabeled decision aids were also more likely to interpret the 
      data presented as favoring a statin with regard to both treatment benefits and 
      risk of side effects (P ≤ 0.01). There were no significant differences in 
      decision priorities (P = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Identifying the options in patient 
      decision aids can influence patient preferences and change how they interpret 
      comparative outcome data.

TI  - Use of stochastic multi-criteria decision analysis to support sustainable 
      management of contaminated sediments.
PG  - 1326-34
LID - 10.1021/es202225x [doi]
AB  - Sustainable management of contaminated sediments requires careful prioritization 
      of available resources and focuses on efforts to optimize decisions that consider 
      environmental, economic, and societal aspects simultaneously. This may be 
      achieved by combining different analytical approaches such as risk analysis (RA), 
      life cycle analysis (LCA), multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and economic 
      valuation methods. We propose the use of stochastic MCDA based on outranking 
      algorithms to implement integrative sustainability strategies for sediment 
      management. In this paper we use the method to select the best sediment 
      management alternatives for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and -furan (PCDD/F) contaminated 
      Grenland fjord in Norway. In the analysis, the benefits of health risk reductions 
      and socio-economic benefits from removing seafood health advisories are evaluated 
      against the detriments of remedial costs and life cycle environmental impacts. A 
      value-plural based weighing of criteria is compared to criteria weights mimicking 
      traditional cost-effectiveness (CEA) and cost-benefit (CBA) analyses. Capping 
      highly contaminated areas in the inner or outer fjord is identified as the most 
      preferable remediation alternative under all criteria schemes and the results are 
      confirmed by a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology can 
      serve as a flexible framework for future decision support and can be a step 
      toward more sustainable decision making for contaminated sediment management. It 
      may be applicable to the broader field of ecosystem restoration for trade-off 
      analysis between ecosystem services and restoration costs.

TI  - Evaluating preferences for colorectal cancer screening in individuals under age 
      50 using the Analytic Hierarchy Process.
PG  - 754
LID - 10.1186/s12913-021-06705-9 [doi]
LID - 754
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force updated 
      their recommendation, stating that individuals ages 45-49 should initiate 
      screening for colorectal cancer. Since several screening strategies are 
      recommended, making a shared decision involves including an individual's 
      preferences. Few studies have included individuals under age 50. In this study, 
      we use a multicriteria decision analysis technique called the Analytic Hierarchy 
      Process to explore preferences for screening strategies and evaluate whether 
      preferences vary by age. METHODS: Participants evaluated a hierarchy with 3 
      decision alternatives (colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, and computed 
      tomography colonography), 3 criteria (test effectiveness, the screening plan, and 
      features of the test) and 7 sub-criteria. We used the linear fit method to 
      calculate consistency ratios and the eigenvector method for group preferences. We 
      conducted sensitivity analysis to assess whether results are robust to change and 
      tested differences in preferences by participant variables using chi-square and 
      analysis of variance. RESULTS: Of the 579 individuals surveyed, 556 (96%) 
      provided complete responses to the AHP portion of the survey. Of these, 247 
      participants gave responses consistent enough (CR < 0.18) to be included in the 
      final analysis. Participants that were either white or have lower health literacy 
      were more likely to be excluded due to inconsistency. Colonoscopy was the 
      preferred strategy in those < 50 and fecal immunochemical test was preferred by 
      those over age 50 (p = 0.002). These results were consistent when we restricted 
      analysis to individuals ages 45-55 (p = 0.011). Participants rated test 
      effectiveness as the most important criteria for making their decision 
      (weight = 0.555). Sensitivity analysis showed our results were robust to shifts 
      in criteria and sub-criteria weights. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal potential 
      differences in preferences for screening strategies by age that could influence 
      the adoption of screening programs to include individuals under age 50. 
      Researchers and practitioners should consider at-home interventions using the 
      Analytic Hierarchy Process to assist with the formulation of preferences that are 
      key to shared decision-making. The costs associated with different preferences 
      for screening strategies should be explored further if limited resources must be 
      allocated to screen individuals ages 45-49.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the use of data dashboards to convey information about a 
      drug's value, and reduce the need to collapse dimensions of value to a single 
      measure. METHODS: Review of the literature on US Drug Value Assessment 
      Frameworks, and discussion of the value of data dashboards to improve the manner 
      in which information on value is displayed. RESULTS: The incremental cost per 
      quality-adjusted life-year ratio is a useful starting point for conversation 
      about a drug's value, but it cannot reflect all of the elements of value about 
      which different audiences care deeply. Data dashboards for drug value assessments 
      can draw from other contexts. Decision makers should be presented with 
      well-designed value dashboards containing various metrics, including conventional 
      cost per quality-adjusted life-year ratios as well as measures of a drug's impact 
      on clinical and patient-centric outcomes, and on budgetary and distributional 
      consequences, to convey a drug's value along different dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The advent of US drug value frameworks in health care has forced a concomitant 
      effort to develop appropriate information displays. Researchers should formally 
      test different formats and elements.

TI  - Prioritization of Resilience Initiatives for Climate-Related Disasters in the 
      Metropolitan City of Venice.
PG  - 931-952
LID - 10.1111/risa.13823 [doi]
AB  - Increases in the magnitude and frequency of climate and other disruptive factors 
      are placing environmental, economic, and social stresses on coastal systems. This 
      is further exacerbated by land use transformations, urbanization, over-tourism, 
      sociopolitical tensions, technological innovations, among others. A 
      scenario-informed multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied in the 
      Metropolitan City of Venice integrating qualitative (i.e., local stakeholder 
      preferences) and quantitative information (i.e., climate-change projections) with 
      the aim of enhancing system resilience to multiple climate-related threats. As 
      part of this analysis, different groups of local stakeholders (e.g., local 
      authorities, civil protection agencies, SMEs, NGOs) were asked to identify 
      critical functions that needs to be sustained. Various policy initiatives were 
      considered to support these critical functions. The MCDA was used to rank the 
      initiatives across several scenarios describing main climate threats (e.g., storm 
      surges, floods, heatwaves, drought). We found that many climate change scenarios 
      were considered to be disruptive to stakeholders and influence alternative 
      ranking. The management alternatives acting on physical domain generally enhance 
      resilience across just a few scenarios while cognitive and informative 
      initiatives provided resilience enhancement across most scenarios considered. 
      With uncertainty of multiple stressors along with projected climate variability, 
      a portfolio of cognitive and physical initiatives is recommended to enhance 
      resilience.

TI  - Searching for consensus through multi-criteria decision analysis. Assessment of 
      screening strategies for hemoglobinopathies in southeastern France.
PG  - 430-49
AB  - Until now, no systematic strategy for the prevention of major hemoglobinopathies 
      has been implemented in southeastern France, in spite of frequencies of 
      beta-thalassemia trait and HbS trait as high as 2.5-8% in some ethnic 
      populations. The purpose of the study was to help a group of experts, brought 
      together by the Regional Center for Disease Control, to reach a consensus about 
      screening for carriers of heterozygote hemoglobinopathies. A multicriteria 
      decision-analysis model was used to take into account not only the costs and 
      effectiveness of potential screening strategies, but also five other qualitative 
      criteria: technical and practical feasibilities, ethical acceptability, 
      information follow-up in time, and global impact on health education. Conclusions 
      differ significantly from those of a pure cost-effectiveness analysis, but a 
      multicriteria approach seems best suited to medical experts' preferences.

TI  - Spatial modelling of disease using data- and knowledge-driven approaches.
PG  - 125-33
LID - 10.1016/j.sste.2011.07.007 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: 
      describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the 
      biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will 
      happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different 
      geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and 
      spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), 
      generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such 
      models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy 
      to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and 
      the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease 
      presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and 
      conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other 
      methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the 
      causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for 
      disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these 
      novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in 
      predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of 
      some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their 
      advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to 
      model various aspects of disease distribution.

      the Comparative Formulary Inclusion of Proton Pump Inhibitors in Qatar.

AB  - PURPOSE: The formulary inclusion of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the 
      government hospital health services in Qatar is not comparative or restricted. 
      Requests to include a PPI in the formulary are typically accepted if evidence of 
      efficacy and tolerability is presented. There are no literature reports of a PPI 
      scoring model that is based on comparatively weighted multiple indications and no 
      reports of PPI selection in Qatar or the Middle East. This study aims to compare 
      first-line use of the PPIs that exist in Qatar. The economic effect of the study 
      recommendations was also quantified. METHODS: A comparative, evidence-based 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model was constructed to follow the 
      multiple indications and pharmacotherapeutic criteria of PPIs. Literature and an 
      expert panel informed the selection criteria of PPIs. Input from the relevant 
      local clinician population steered the relative weighting of selection criteria. 
      Comparatively scored PPIs, exceeding a defined score threshold, were recommended 
      for selection. FINDINGS: Weighted model scores were successfully developed, with 
      95% CI and 5% margin of error. The model comprised 7 main criteria and 38 
      subcriteria. Main criteria are indication, dosage frequency, treatment duration, 
      best published evidence, available formulations, drug interactions, and 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Most weight was achieved for the 
      indications selection criteria. Esomeprazole and rabeprazole were suggested as 
      formulary options, followed by lansoprazole for nonformulary use. The estimated 
      effect of the study recommendations was up to a 15.3% reduction in the annual PPI 
      expenditure. Robustness of study conclusions against variabilities in study 
      inputs was confirmed via sensitivity analyses. IMPLICATIONS: The implementation 
      of a locally developed PPI-specific comparative MCDA scoring model, which is 
      multiweighted indication and criteria based, into the Qatari formulary selection 
      practices is a successful evidence-based cost-cutting exercise. Esomeprazole and 
      rabeprazole should be the first-line choice from among the PPIs available at the 
      Qatari government hospital health services.

TI  - The Use of Evidence-Informed Deliberative Processes for Health Benefit Package 
      Design in Kazakhstan.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph191811412 [doi]
LID - 11412
AB  - Kazakhstan strives to obtain Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by using health 
      technology assessment (HTA) for determining their health benefit package. This 
      paper reports on employing evidence-informed deliberative processes (EDPs), a 
      practical and stepwise approach to enhance legitimate health benefit package 
      design in Kazakhstan. METHODS: The Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan approved the 
      operationalization and application of EDPs during March 2019 and December 2020. 
      We used a combination of desk research, conducting HTA, online surveys as well as 
      a face-to-face workshop in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, and two online workshops to 
      prioritize 25 selected health technologies. During the latter, we tested two 
      alternative approaches to prioritization: quantitative multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) and the use of decision rules. RESULTS: For each of the HTA 
      reports, evidence summaries were developed according to the decision criteria 
      (safety, social priority disease, severity of disease, effectiveness, 
      cost-effectiveness, level of evidence, financial risk protection and budget 
      impact). When appraising the evidence, the advisory committee preferred using 
      quantitative MCDA, and only when this would result in any controversy could 
      decision rules be applied. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several challenges, including a 
      partial disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of the 
      process will likely play a key role in determining an evidence-informed and 
      transparent health benefit package.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-8-270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare decisionmaking is a complex process relying on disparate 
      types of evidence and value judgments. Our objectives for this study were to 
      develop a practical framework to facilitate decisionmaking in terms of supporting 
      the deliberative process, providing access to evidence, and enhancing the 
      communication of decisions. METHODS: Extensive analyses of the literature and of 
      documented decisionmaking processes around the globe were performed to explore 
      what steps are currently used to make decisions with respect to context (from 
      evidence generation to communication of decision) and thought process (conceptual 
      components of decisions). Needs and methodologies available to support 
      decisionmaking were identified to lay the groundwork for the EVIDEM framework. 
      RESULTS: A framework was developed consisting of seven modules that can evolve 
      over the life cycle of a healthcare intervention. Components of decision that 
      could be quantified, i.e., intrinsic value of a healthcare intervention and 
      quality of evidence available, were organized into matrices. A multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) Value Matrix (VM) was developed to include the 15 
      quantifiable components that are currently considered in decisionmaking. A 
      methodology to synthesize the evidence needed for each component of the VM was 
      developed including electronic access to full text source documents. A Quality 
      Matrix was designed to quantify three criteria of quality for the 12 types of 
      evidence usually required by decisionmakers. An integrated system was developed 
      to optimize data analysis, synthesis and validation by experts, compatible with a 
      collaborative structure. CONCLUSION: The EVIDEM framework promotes transparent 
      and efficient healthcare decisionmaking through systematic assessment and 
      dissemination of the evidence and values on which decisions are based. It 
      provides a collaborative framework that could connect all stakeholders and serve 
      the healthcare community at local, national and international levels by allowing 
      sharing of data, resources and values. Validation and further development is 
      needed to explore the full potential of this approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac catheterization laboratories (cath labs) are commonly 
      designed to achieve the best clinical outcomes while being efficient. This study 
      develops methods to support healthcare managers in analyzing the added value of 
      improvement measures, following a value-based healthcare (VBHC) framework. 
      METHODS: Based on a sociotechnical approach, the applied methods aimed to 
      increase efficiency, reduce duplication of tasks, cut costs, and improve patient 
      care, while creating a more inclusive and trusting decision making process. 
      Within the process of building a multicriteria evaluation model, meetings, 
      interviews, and a decision conference were designed. In parallel, a workflow 
      discrete event simulation model was built to replicate current patient flow and 
      activities and to reproduce the impact of implementing improvement measures and 
      variations in human resources. RESULTS: Four evaluation criteria were considered 
      for workflow improvement: contribution to the efficiency of the admission 
      process, compliance with schedules, agility among procedures, and human resources 
      training. The designed improvement measures sought to 1) improve the start-up of 
      the day, 2) improve pre-exam assessment, and 3) improve staff training. Results 
      prioritize 'Measure 2' and demonstrate that improving human resources allocation 
      increases efficiency and offers significant cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed solution is in line with VBHC principles, as it improves efficiency and 
      care delivery while optimizing costs. Simulation was an effective tool to 
      replicate and explore possible changes. Multicriteria modeling proved to be a 
      useful approach for a transparent prioritization and redesign of improvements in 
      the healthcare sector.

TI  - Daily food planning for families under Covid-19: combining analytic hierarchy

AB  - In many households, preparation of food in normal times proves to be problematic, 
      particularly when parents endeavour to keep their children on a balanced diet. 
      The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this problem imposing the 
      requirement of social distancing, which led to disruptions in the food supply 
      chain and multiplication of responsibilities faced by families with children. The 
      present study revisits the standard "Diet Problem" to address these challenges 
      and to develop a participatory approach to provide a diversified weekly meal plan 
      that is easy and fun but simultaneously complies with the unique requirements of 
      each participant. This is done by providing a novel framework, which combines 
      linear optimisation with the Parsimonious Analytic Hierarchy Process, a method 
      for individual choices. This novel approach to participatory modelling is tested 
      within two young family settings in Brazil. The model produced through this 
      contemporary framework provides a weekly menu that best meets expectations of the 
      members of a young family in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Integrating social justice concerns into economic evaluation for healthcare and 
      public health: A systematic review.

AB  - Social justice is the moral imperative to avoid and remediate unfair 
      distributions of societal disadvantage. In priority setting in healthcare and 
      public health, social justice reaches beyond fairness in the distribution of 
      health outcomes and economic impacts to encompass fairness in the distribution of 
      policy impacts upon other dimensions of well-being. There is an emerging 
      awareness of the need for economic evaluation to integrate all such concerns. We 
      performed a systematic review (1) to describe methodological solutions suitable 
      for integrating social justice concerns into economic evaluation, and (2) to 
      describe the challenges that those solutions face. To be included, publications 
      must have captured fairness considerations that (a) involve cross-dimensional 
      subjective personal life experience and (b) can be manifested at the level of 
      subpopulations. We identified relevant publications using an electronic search in 
      EMBASE, PubMed, EconLit, PsycInfo, Philosopher's Index, and Scopus, including 
      publications available in English in the past 20 years. Two reviewers 
      independently appraised candidate publications, extracted data, and synthesized 
      findings in narrative form. Out of 2388 publications reviewed, 26 were included. 
      Solutions sought either to incorporate relevant fairness considerations directly 
      into economic evaluation or to report them alongside cost-effectiveness measures. 
      The majority of reviewed solutions, if adapted to integrate social justice 
      concerns, would require their explicit quantification. Four broad challenges 
      related to the implementation of these solutions were identified: clarifying the 
      normative basis; measuring and determining the relative importance of criteria 
      representing that basis; combining the criteria; and evaluating trade-offs. All 
      included solutions must grapple with an inherent tension: they must either face 
      the normative and operational challenges of quantifying social justice concerns 
      or accede to offering incomplete policy guidance. Interdisciplinary research and 
      broader collaborations are crucial to address these challenges and to support due 
      attention to social justice in priority setting.

TI  - Incorporating environmental and sustainability considerations into health 
      technology assessment and clinical and public health guidelines: a scoping 
      review.
PG  - e84
LID - 10.1017/S0266462322003282 [doi]
AB  - Healthcare systems account for a substantial proportion of global carbon 
      emissions and contribute to wider environmental degradation. This scoping review 
      aimed to summarize the evidence currently available on incorporation of 
      environmental and sustainability considerations into health technology 
      assessments (HTAs) and guidelines to support the National In stitute for Health 
      and Care Excellence and analogous bodies in other jurisdictions developing 
      theirown methods and processes. Overall, 7,653 articles were identified, of which 
      24 were included in this review and split into three key areas - HTA (10 
      studies), healthcare guidelines (4 studies), and food and dietary guidelines (10 
      studies). Methodological reviews discussed the pros and cons of different 
      approaches to integrate environmental considerations into HTAs, including 
      adjustments to conventional cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-benefit analysis, 
      and multicriteria decision analysis. The case studies illustrated the challenges 
      of putting this into practice, such as lack of disaggregated data to evaluate the 
      impact of single technologies and difficulty in conducting thorough life cycle 
      assessments that consider the full environmental effects. Evidence was scant on 
      the incorporation of environmental impacts in clinical practice and public health 
      guidelines. Food and dietary guidelines used adapted CUA based on life cycle 
      assessments, simulation modeling, and qualitative judgments made by expert 
      panels. There is uncertainty on how HTA and guideline committees will handle 
      trade-offs between health and environment, especially when balancing 
      environmental harms that fall largely on society with health benefits for 
      individuals. Further research is warranted to enable integration of environmental 
      considerations into HTA and clinical and public health guidelines.

TI  - Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the efficiency of Portuguese state-owned 
      enterprise hospitals.
PG  - 101387
LID - 10.1016/j.seps.2022.101387 [doi]
AB  - This paper uses Value-Based Data Envelopment Analysis (VBDEA), to assess the 
      impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the efficiency of 37 state-owned enterprises 
      (SOE) hospitals by employing data publicly available from the Portuguese Health 
      Service database between January and November 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
      Furthermore, a productivity index (specifically adjusted to the VBDEA approach) 
      is also used that allows identifying which factors are behind the relative 
      efficiency changes of these hospitals. The factors considered to perform the 
      efficiency assessment of the Portuguese SOE hospitals include labour, capacity, 
      and activity-related indicators. Out of the 37 SOE hospitals, 21 and 17 were 
      efficient in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Irrespective of the value functions 
      considered, the hospitals more often viewed as a reference for best practices 
      were Santa Maria Maior, Tâmega e Sousa and Entre Douro e Vouga. Santa Maria Maior 
      and Algarve were the only hospitals found to be robustly efficient for both 
      years. Overall, the majority of SOE hospitals showed negative productivity 
      (except for Évora and Santa Maria Maior) and all of them presented negative 
      technological change, thus highlighting the massive impact that the COVID-19 
      outbreak has had on the performance of these hospitals. An additional conclusion 
      is that inefficient hospitals substantially increased all their resources in 2020 
      as compared to inefficient hospitals in 2019, suggesting that the inefficiency of 
      these hospitals was not due to the lack of resources. Finally, irrespective of 
      the model employed, the hospitals located in the Portuguese northern region were 
      more resilient to the COVID-19 crisis. All in all, to become more resilient (even 
      for future COVID-19 outbreaks), hospitals should undertake changes that are 
      advantageous irrespective of the obstacles they face and that are even beneficial 
      during normal times. A culture of cooperation within and across hospitals should 
      also be cultivated, which allows exchanging resources where they can be used more 
      efficiently.

TI  - Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for environmental development and transfer of 
      antibiotic resistance.
PG  - 993-1001
LID - 10.1289/ehp.1206316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only recently has the environment been clearly implicated in the risk 
      of antibiotic resistance to clinical outcome, but to date there have been few 
      documented approaches to formally assess these risks. OBJECTIVE: We examined 
      possible approaches and sought to identify research needs to enable human health 
      risk assessments (HHRA) that focus on the role of the environment in the failure 
      of antibiotic treatment caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. METHODS: The 
      authors participated in a workshop held 4-8 March 2012 in Québec, Canada, to 
      define the scope and objectives of an environmental assessment of 
      antibiotic-resistance risks to human health. We focused on key elements of 
      environmental-resistance-development "hot spots," exposure assessment (unrelated 
      to food), and dose response to characterize risks that may improve 
      antibiotic-resistance management options. DISCUSSION: Various novel aspects to 
      traditional risk assessments were identified to enable an assessment of 
      environmental antibiotic resistance. These include a) accounting for an added 
      selective pressure on the environmental resistome that, over time, allows for 
      development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB); b) identifying and describing 
      rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the relevant environmental "hot spot" 
      compartments; and c) modifying traditional dose-response approaches to address 
      doses of ARB for various health outcomes and pathways. CONCLUSIONS: We propose 
      that environmental aspects of antibiotic-resistance development be included in 
      the processes of any HHRA addressing ARB. Because of limited available data, a 
      multicriteria decision analysis approach would be a useful way to undertake an 
      HHRA of environmental antibiotic resistance that informs risk managers.

TI  - Developing and Refining New Candidate Criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
      Classification: An International Collaboration.
PG  - 571-581
LID - 10.1002/acr.23317 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define candidate criteria within multiphase development of systemic 
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria, jointly supported by the 
      American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. 
      Prior steps included item generation and reduction by Delphi exercise, further 
      narrowed to 21 items in a nominal group technique exercise. Our objectives were 
      to apply an evidence-based approach to the 21 candidate criteria, and to develop 
      hierarchical organization of criteria within domains. METHODS: A literature 
      review identified the sensitivity and specificity of the 21 candidate criteria. 
      Data on the performance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion and 
      operating characteristics of the candidate criteria in early SLE patients were 
      evaluated. Candidate criteria were hierarchically organized into clinical and 
      immunologic domains, and definitions were refined in an iterative process. 
      RESULTS: Based on the data, consensus was reached to use a positive ANA of ≥1:80 
      titer (HEp-2 cells immunofluorescence) as an entry criterion and to have 7 
      clinical and 3 immunologic domains, with hierarchical organization of criteria 
      within domains. Definitions of the candidate criteria were specified. CONCLUSION: 
      Using a data-driven process, consensus was reached on new, refined criteria 
      definitions and organization based on operating characteristics. This work will 
      be followed by a multicriteria decision analysis exercise to weight criteria and 
      to identify a threshold score for classification on a continuous probability 
      scale.

TI  - Proposal for a Tool for Assessing Access to Water in Rural Communities: a Case 
      Study in the Brazilian Semi-arid.
PG  - 529-542
LID - 10.1007/s00267-022-01600-3 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes a Water Access Index (WAI). Using this tool, decision-makers 
      can identify and prioritize areas that need state intervention to develop actions 
      to guarantee rural population access to water. Thus, was carried out is a case 
      study, rural communities in the semi-arid region of Brazil to validate the 
      suggested method. The WAI is based on a combined method of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA), Geographic Information System (GIS), cluster analysis (CA) using 
      Ward's agglomeration method and participation of rural inhabitants. The data for 
      calculating the WAI were obtained by conducting interviews following a script of 
      themes in the structured questionnaire closed to 370 residents of the communities 
      evaluated. To calculate the WAI, weightings were used, in which the scores of the 
      indicators and the weights of the dimensions were determined and analyzed using 
      the Delphi method, what found to be a valid method for calculating the dimensions 
      and indicators weights. Due to difficulty of rural population to have water 
      access and suffer from drought, the proposed model showed appropriate to conduct 
      a robust and well-structured decision-making. The main contributions were the 
      study in region suffering from drought and difficulty in water access, as well as 
      the combination of MCDA, SIG, CA and participation of rural inhabitants methods 
      to aid in this problem. For use in other areas, researchers need to conduct 
      public and specialized consultations to adjust the dimension weights, so the WAI 
      method can estimate the water access situation and generate maps anywhere in the 
      world for decision-making.

AB  - The health industry is amongst the most affected systems in terms of 
      multiobjective decision-making, rendering the final solution, vulnerable to 
      errors; however, multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) emerges as a supportive 
      tool for the process of decision-making. Therefore, the present study seeks to 
      offer an MCDA framework for assessing and identifying the potential influence of 
      socioeconomic risk factors on noncommunicable disease mortality. We adopted a 
      subjective approach of grey-based Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis 
      (SWARA) and COmplex PRoportional Assessment (COPRAS) approach to calculate 
      weights of parameters and criteria, respectively, and then rank them based on 
      their degree of significance. The findings reveal that CRD mortality is 
      potentially affected by the selected socioeconomic risk variables followed by IHD 
      and cancer. Implementing MCDA techniques in the present study will assist the 
      public health practitioners and policymakers in drawing decisions on the best 
      strategy to reduce CRD mortality, which contributes significantly to raising 
      overall mortality.

AB  - Emerging environmental threats such as novel chemical compounds, biological 
      agents, and nanomaterials present serious challenges to traditional models of 
      risk analysis and regulatory risk management processes. Even a massive expansion 
      of risk and life-cycle assessment research efforts is unlikely to keep pace with 
      rapid technological change resulting in new and modified materials with changing 
      properties. Therefore, it is essential to have a framework for interpreting 
      available information in the context of high uncertainty and a strategy for 
      prioritizing research efforts to reduce those uncertainties that are most 
      critical. We discuss how integrating the three analytic approaches of risk 
      assessment, life-cycle assessment, and multicriteria decision analysis into a 
      framework permits understanding uncertainty and prioritizes needs for scientific 
      research. Our approach is illustrated with two separate cases: nanomaterials and 
      contaminated sediment remediation.

      last few decades.
PG  - 927
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10632-5 [doi]
AB  - Soil degradation has become a critical global environmental challenge as a result 
      of rapid population growth, intensified erosion, and increased global warming. 
      Depletion of nutrients, decreased infiltration, availability of water in the 
      subsoil, silting, and eutrophication of surface water resources are directly 
      associated with soil degradation. Water erosion is one of the primary causes of 
      erosion. The principal objective of this study was to understand how climate 
      change and land use have affected susceptibility to erosion in the 
      central-eastern region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil, over the past few 
      decades. Using the technique of multicriteria decision analysis and comparison of 
      thematic layers in pairs, different factors that contribute to soil erosion were 
      integrated in a GIS environment to map erosion hotspots. The results indicated 
      increasing very high, high, and medium erosion susceptibility class percentage. 
      Slope and soil types were the most sensitive factors; however, changes in land 
      use, in particular, increased land cultivation and expanded areas highly 
      susceptible to erosion in late 2019. The results of this study will assist in 
      implementing soil conservation practices in such areas, reducing soil 
      degradation, and increasing productivity.

AB  - Semi-arid regions often face severe drought events that reduce agricultural and 
      livestock production. In recent years, some international studies have used 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches combined with geographic 
      information systems (GIS-MCDA) to support decision-makers in assessing the 
      suitability of agricultural land for irrigation in semi-arid regions. Unlike 
      previous studies, which have only considered a single source of water for crop 
      irrigation, this study proposes a GIS-MCDA approach that considers all 
      potentially available local water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface water, and 
      wastewater) as possible alternatives for better multisource water resource 
      management (MWRM) in regions facing water shortages. The geospatial multicriteria 
      evaluation implemented in this study considers a series of technical, 
      environmental, and agricultural productivity criteria using the analytical 
      hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three independent baseline maps were generated, 
      showing the spatial distribution of suitable areas for crop irrigation for each 
      considered water source in the studied area. Surface water, groundwater, and 
      wastewater offered suitable crop irrigation for 83%, 70%, and 26% of the study 
      area, respectively. Overlapping these areas produced a final map showing all the 
      feasible areas for each crop irrigation alternative at the same time. The MWRM 
      approach considering all water sources increased the coverage of suitable areas 
      to be irrigated in the study area by 2.2%, 20.4%, and more than 225% compared to 
      considering surface water, groundwater, and wastewater, respectively, 
      independently. The GIS-MCDA framework proposed in this study provides better 
      support for decision-makers and stakeholders, favouring a reduction in possible 
      conflicts over water scarcity, the diversification of irrigated crops, and an 
      improvement in the quality-quantitative management of water resources in 
      semi-arid regions.

TI  - Bridging health technology assessment (HTA) with multicriteria decision analyses 
      (MCDA): field testing of the EVIDEM framework for coverage decisions by a public 
      payer in Canada.
PG  - 329
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-11-329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Consistent healthcare decision making requires systematic 
      consideration of decision criteria and evidence available to inform them. This 
      can be tackled by combining multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and Health 
      Technology Assessment (HTA). The objective of this study was to field-test a 
      decision support framework (EVIDEM), explore its utility to a drug advisory 
      committee and test its reliability over time. METHODS: Tramadol for chronic 
      non-cancer pain was selected by the health plan as a case study relevant to their 
      context. Based on extensive literature review, a by-criterion HTA report was 
      developed to provide synthesized evidence for each criterion of the framework (14 
      criteria for the MCDA Core Model and 6 qualitative criteria for the Contextual 
      Tool). During workshop sessions, committee members tested the framework in three 
      steps by assigning: 1) weights to each criterion of the MCDA Core Model 
      representing individual perspective; 2) scores for tramadol for each criterion of 
      the MCDA Core Model using synthesized data; and 3) qualitative impacts of 
      criteria of the Contextual Tool on the appraisal. Utility and reliability of the 
      approach were explored through discussion, survey and test-retest. Agreement 
      between test and retest data was analyzed by calculating intra-rater correlation 
      coefficients (ICCs) for weights, scores and MCDA value estimates. RESULTS: The 
      framework was found useful by the drug advisory committee in supporting 
      systematic consideration of a broad range of criteria to promote a consistent 
      approach to appraising healthcare interventions. Directly integrated in the 
      framework as a "by-criterion" HTA report, synthesized evidence for each criterion 
      facilitated its consideration, although this was sometimes limited by lack of 
      relevant data. Test-retest analysis showed fair to good consistency of weights, 
      scores and MCDA value estimates at the individual level (ICC ranging from 0.676 
      to 0.698), thus lending some support for the reliability of the approach. 
      Overall, committee members endorsed the inclusion of most framework criteria and 
      revealed important areas of discussion, clarification and adaptation of the 
      framework to the needs of the committee. CONCLUSIONS: By promoting systematic 
      consideration of all decision criteria and the underlying evidence, the framework 
      allows a consistent approach to appraising healthcare interventions. Further 
      testing and validation are needed to advance MCDA approaches in healthcare 
      decisionmaking.

TI  - How to select a best-value biological medicine? A practical model to support 
      hospital pharmacists.
PG  - 2001-2011
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxac235 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: With the growing availability of biosimilars on the global market, 
      clinicians and pharmacists have multiple off-patent biological products to choose 
      from. Besides the competitiveness of the product's price, other criteria should 
      be considered when selecting a best-value biological. This article aims to 
      provide a model to facilitate transparent best-value biological selection in the 
      off-patent biological medicines segment. SUMMARY: The presented model was 
      developed on the basis of established multicriteria decision analysis tools for 
      rational and transparent medicine selection, ie, the System of Objectified 
      Judgement Analysis and InforMatrix. Criteria for the model were informed by 
      earlier research, a literature search, and evaluation by the authors. The 
      developed model includes up-to-date guidance on criteria that can be considered 
      in selection and provides background on the allocation of weights that may aid 
      hospital pharmacists and clinicians with decision-making in practice. Three main 
      categories of criteria besides price were identified and included in the model: 
      (1) product-driven criteria, (2) service-driven criteria, and (3) patient-driven 
      criteria. Product-driven criteria include technical product features and licensed 
      therapeutic indications. Service-driven criteria consist of supply conditions, 
      value-added services, and environment and sustainability criteria. Patient-driven 
      criteria contain product administration elements such as ease of use and service 
      elements such as patient support programs. Relative weighting of the criteria is 
      largely context dependent and should in a given setting be determined at the 
      beginning of the process. CONCLUSION: The practical model described here may 
      support hospital pharmacists and clinicians with transparent and evidence-based 
      best-value biological selection in clinical practice.

TI  - Assessment of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency in Citrus Orchards Using AHP.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18115667 [doi]
LID - 5667
AB  - Irrigation water use efficiency, the small size of the orchards, and part-time 
      farmers are major issues for Spanish citriculture. How should irrigation water 
      use efficiency be assessed? Does irrigation water use efficiency improve when 
      increasing the size of the orchards? Are full-time farmers more efficient in 
      irrigation water use than part-time ones? To address these three questions, we 
      propose to apply a new multicriteria approach based on the analytic hierarchy 
      process (AHP) technique and the participation of a group of experts. A new 
      synthetic irrigation efficiency index (IEI) was proposed and tested using data 
      from an irrigation community (IC) and a cooperative of farmers in the East of 
      Spain. The results showed that the size of the orchards had no relation with the 
      IEI scoring but full-time farmers tended to have better IEI scores and, thus, 
      were more efficient. These results were obtained from a sample of 24 orchards of 
      oranges, navelina variety, growing in a very similar environment, and agronomical 
      characteristics. The proposed methodology can be a useful benchmarking tool for 
      improving the irrigation water management in other ICs taking into account the 
      issues related to farm data sharing recorded during the case study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To improve surgical performance, image-guided (IG) technologies are 
      increasingly introduced. Yet, it is unknown which oncological procedures yield 
      most value from these technologies. This study aimed to select the most promising 
      IG technology per oncologic indication. METHODS: An Analytic Hierarchical Process 
      was used to evaluate three IG technologies: navigation, optical imaging, and 
      augmented reality, in five oncologic indications compared with usual care. 
      Sixteen decision criteria were selected. The relative importance of the criteria 
      and the expected performance of the technologies were evaluated among surgeons. 
      The combination of these scores gives the expected value per technology. RESULTS: 
      On criteria level, sparing critical tissue (9%-18%) and reducing the risk of 
      local recurrence (11%-27%) were most important. Navigation was preferred in three 
      indications-removal of lymph nodes (42%), liver (47%), and rectal tumors (33%). 
      In removing rectal tumors, optical imaging was equally preferred (34%). In 
      removing breast and tongue tumors, no technology was clearly preferred. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In selecting IG technologies, especially optical and navigation 
      technologies are expected to add value in addition to usual care. Further 
      development of those technologies for the preferred indications seems valuable. 
      Multi-attribute analysis showed to be useful in prioritization of conducting 
      clinical studies and steer research and development initiatives.

AB  - The Paiva River is considered one of the least polluted rivers in Europe and its 
      watershed has a high conservation value. However, the Paiva River basin suffers 
      pressures related with recurrent disturbances in land use, such as forest fires, 
      agricultural activities, urbanization and pressures that affect the natural 
      hydromorphological conditions and the continuity of watercourses. Blue and Green 
      Infrastructures (BGINs) emerge to improve biodiversity, sustainability and the 
      supply of ecosystem services while improving socioeconomic aspects. Thus, this 
      article aims to identify priority areas in the basin, for intervention with these 
      infrastructures. For that, a spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) was 
      carried out according to several data related to the Paiva River Basin. As local 
      politicians and responsible entities for the natural resources management are the 
      main experts on the problems and their possible solutions at the local level, 
      they were involved in this decision-making model. Therefore, these specialized 
      stakeholders did the weighting assignment according to the most or least 
      importance of the same for the work. The map of priority locations to implement 
      BGINs was obtained in the sequel. To the top 5 priority areas, stakeholders 
      attributed the best solutions based on nature. The most recommended BGINs were 
      recovery/maintenance of riparian vegetation and conservation and reforestation of 
      the native forest, both presented in four of the five areas, and introduction of 
      fuel management strips presented in three of the five areas. Thus, we concluded 
      that it is extremely important to include the communities and the competent 
      entities of nature and environment management in scientific projects related to 
      conservation, forming a synergy that makes it possible to combine scientific 
      knowledge with local experience acquired in the field. This project uses a very 
      flexible methodology of local data and can be a great example to be implemented 
      in other hydrographic basins anywhere in the world.

AB  - Background and aimsPriority setting is a challenging task for public health 
      professionals. To support health professionals with this and in following a 
      recommendation from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
      (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO), 35 European parasitologists attended a 
      workshop from 8-12 February 2016 to rank food-borne parasites (FBP) in terms of 
      their importance for Europe and regions within Europe. Methods: Countries were 
      divided into European regions according to those used by the European Society of 
      Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. We used the same multicriteria 
      decision analysis approach as the FAO/WHO, for comparison of results, and a 
      modified version, for better regional representation. Twenty-five FBP were scored 
      in subgroups, using predefined decision rules. Results: At the European level, 
      Echinococcus multilocularis ranked first, followed by Toxoplasma gondii and 
      Trichinella spiralis. At the regional level, E. multilocularis ranked highest in 
      Northern and Eastern Europe, E. granulosus in South-Western and South-Eastern 
      Europe, and T. gondii in Western Europe. Anisakidae, ranking 17th globally, 
      appeared in each European region's top 10. In contrast, Taenia solium, ranked 
      highest globally but 10th for Europe. Conclusions: FBP of importance in Europe 
      differ from those of importance globally, requiring targeted surveillance 
      systems, intervention measures, and preparedness planning that differ across the 
      world and across Europe.

TI  - Model to support intervention prioritization for the control of Aedes aegypti in 
      Brazil: a multi-criteria approach.
PG  - 932
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-13006-1 [doi]
LID - 932
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite continuous strategic investments to mitigate the complexity 
      involving arboviruses control, it is still necessary to further research methods 
      and techniques to achieve in depth knowledge and shorter response times in the 
      application of intervention activities. Consequently, the current work focused 
      its efforts on the development of a multicriteria decision support model for the 
      prioritization of prompt response activities for Aedes aegypti control, based on 
      a case study in the city of Natal/RN. METHOD: The research was carried out in 
      three stages: a) preliminary; b) modelling and choice; and c) finalization; the 
      second stage was made possible by the Flexible and Interactive Tradeoff 
      (FITradeoff) method for ranking problematic. Furthermore, the research 
      encompassed ten actors who were involved in the model construction, eight 
      internal and two external to the Natal Zoonoses Control Center (ZCC-Natal) as 
      well as the observation of four operating scenarios for arboviruses control, 
      based on transmission levels; and, evaluation of eleven alternatives from six 
      different criteria perspectives. RESULTS: Rankings of the interventions evaluated 
      in each of the four control operation scenarios present in the city of Natal/RN 
      were obtained, considering technical criteria guided by the Pan American Health 
      Organization (PAHO). CONCLUSIONS: As a result, it was developed a structured 
      decision-making model that could help decision makers to minimize the effects and 
      risks associated with the proliferation of the vector.

TI  - Risk Ranking of Antimicrobial-Resistant Hazards Found in Meat in Switzerland.
PG  - 1070-1084

AB  - Human exposure to bacteria resistant to antimicrobials and transfer of related 
      genes is a complex issue and occurs, among other pathways, via meat consumption. 
      In a context of limited resources, the prioritization of risk management 
      activities is essential. Since the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation 
      differs substantially between countries, prioritization should be country 
      specific. The objective of this study was to develop a systematic and transparent 
      framework to rank combinations of bacteria species resistant to selected 
      antimicrobial classes found in meat, based on the risk they represent for public 
      health in Switzerland. A risk assessment model from slaughter to consumption was 
      developed following the Codex Alimentarius guidelines for risk analysis of 
      foodborne AMR. Using data from the Swiss AMR monitoring program, 208 combinations 
      of animal species/bacteria/antimicrobial classes were identified as relevant 
      hazards. Exposure assessment and hazard characterization scores were developed 
      and combined using multicriteria decision analysis. The effect of changing 
      weights of scores was explored with sensitivity analysis. Attributing equal 
      weights to each score, poultry-associated combinations represented the highest 
      risk. In particular, contamination with extended-spectrum β-lactamase/plasmidic 
      AmpC-producing Escherichia coli in poultry meat ranked high for both exposure and 
      hazard characterization. Tetracycline- or macrolide-resistant Enterococcus spp., 
      as well as fluoroquinolone- or macrolide-resistant Campylobacter jejuni, ranked 
      among combinations with the highest risk. This study provides a basis for 
      prioritizing future activities to mitigate the risk associated with foodborne AMR 
      in Switzerland. A user-friendly version of the model was provided to risk 
      managers; it can easily be adjusted to the constantly evolving knowledge on AMR.

TI  - Multi-criteria analysis in the health area: selection of the most appropriate 
      triage system for the emergency care units in natal.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/s12911-020-1054-y [doi]
LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiobjective decision-making processes present a high degree of 
      complexity in their solution, and tools such as multicriteria decision analysis 
      appear as a way to facilitate the decision-makers' solution and ensure that the 
      decision is made cohesively and efficiently. In the public health sector, 
      decisions are even more delicate because they work not only with the direct 
      influence of human needs, but also with limited financial resources. An important 
      point for the emergency care units is the triage system, which consists of a 
      pre-evaluation of the patients, classifying them according to the degree of life 
      risk. Through triage, the patient can be attended more quickly and efficiently, 
      streamlining the whole process. Thus, the present research endeavored to 
      determine the most appropriate triage protocol for emergency healthcare units in 
      Natal-RN city in Brazil and may help others less advanced countries to determine 
      the most appropriate triage protocol for emergency healthcare. METHODS: In this 
      study, we used the multicriteria analysis method known as FITradeoff. In 
      addition, interviews and structured questionnaires applied with nurses, 
      specialists and directors. RESULTS: Based on the questionnaires and preferences 
      presented by the decision-makers, the Spanish Triage System was the most suitable 
      protocol for the emergency care units, which presented with high ease of use and 
      implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This study reached its main objective, which was to

PG  - e05495
LID - 10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5495 [doi]
LID - e05495
AB  - Parasites are important food-borne pathogens. Their complex lifecycles, varied 
      transmission routes, and prolonged periods between infection and symptoms mean 
      that the public health burden and relative importance of different transmission 
      routes are often difficult to assess. Furthermore, there are challenges in 
      detection and diagnostics, and variations in reporting. A Europe-focused ranking 
      exercise, using multicriteria decision analysis, identified potentially 
      food-borne parasites of importance, and that are currently not routinely 
      controlled in food. These are Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma gondii and 
      Echinococcus spp. Infection with these parasites in humans and animals, or their 
      occurrence in food, is not notifiable in all Member States. This Opinion reviews 
      current methods for detection, identification and tracing of these parasites in 
      relevant foods, reviews literature on food-borne pathways, examines information 
      on their occurrence and persistence in foods, and investigates possible control 
      measures along the food chain. The differences between these three parasites are 
      substantial, but for all there is a paucity of well-established, standardised, 
      validated methods that can be applied across the range of relevant foods. 
      Furthermore, the prolonged period between infection and clinical symptoms (from 
      several days for Cryptosporidium to years for Echinococcus spp.) means that 
      source attribution studies are very difficult. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the 
      domestic animal lifecycle (involving dogs and livestock) for Echinoccocus 
      granulosus means that this parasite is controllable. For Echinococcus 
      multilocularis, for which the lifecycle involves wildlife (foxes and rodents), 
      control would be expensive and complicated, but could be achieved in targeted 
      areas with sufficient commitment and resources. Quantitative risk assessments 
      have been described for Toxoplasma in meat. However, for 
      T. gondii and Cryptosporidium as faecal contaminants, development of validated 
      detection methods, including survival/infectivity assays and consensus molecular 
      typing protocols, are required for the development of quantitative risk 
      assessments and efficient control measures.

TI  - Building consensus in environmental impact assessment through multicriteria 
      modeling and sensitivity analysis.
PG  - 469-81
AB  - Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) increasingly is being applied in 
      environmental impact assessment (EIA). In this article, two MCDA techniques, 
      stochastic analytic hierarchy process and compromise programming, are combined to 
      ascertain the environmental impacts of and to rank two alternative sites for 
      Mexico City's new airport. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to 
      determine the probability of changes in rank ordering given uncertainty in the 
      hierarchy structure, decision criteria weights, and decision criteria 
      performances. Results demonstrate that sensitivity analysis is fundamental for 
      attaining consensus among members of interdisciplinary teams and for settling 
      debates in controversial projects. It was concluded that sensitivity analysis is 
      critical for achieving a transparent and technically defensible MCDA 
      implementation in controversial EIA.

TI  - Anticancer activity of protein fractions from chia (Salvia hispanica L.).
PG  - 2861-2871
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.15780 [doi]
AB  - Salvia hispanica demonstrated to be a source of protein fractions with anticancer 
      activity. The effect of the protein fractions <1, 1-3, and 3-5 kDa, obtained by 
      ultrafiltration of the S. hispanica hydrolysate, was evaluated on the cellular 
      viability of four cancer cell lines (MCF-7, Caco2, PC-3, and HepG2) and on human 
      fibroblasts (hFB) at different concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg/ml). The 
      protein fractions did not show cytotoxic effects on hFB. The protein 
      fraction <1 kDa at 1 mg/ml showed the highest statistical effect on the cellular 
      viability of all evaluated cancer lines; thus, its amino acid sequence was 
      analyzed. From the multicriteria decision analysis of the peptide sequences 
      obtained by mass spectrometry, the peptide KLKKNL with potential anticancer 
      activity was selected. In conclusion, protein fractions could represent a 
      therapeutic option for cancer treatment. However, further investigations are 
      necessary to establish conclusive arguments. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The work of 
      this article is based on the background of the increasing potential of peptides 
      for the treatment of chronic diseases. The results of this study present peptides 
      of low molecular weight, obtained from chia seeds, as a potential adjuvant option 
      for cancer treatment.

LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2014.11.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients, physicians, and other decision makers make implicit but 
      inevitable trade-offs among risks and benefits of treatments. Many methods have 
      been proposed to promote transparent and rigorous benefit-risk analysis (BRA). 
      OBJECTIVE: To propose a framework for classifying BRA methods on the basis of key 
      factors that matter most for patients by using a common mathematical notation and 
      compare their results using a hypothetical example. METHODS: We classified the 
      available BRA methods into three categories: 1) unweighted metrics, which use 
      only probabilities of benefits and risks; 2) metrics that incorporate preference 
      weights and that account for the impact and duration of benefits and risks; and 
      3) metrics that incorporate weights based on decision makers' opinions. We used 
      two hypothetical antiplatelet drugs (a and b) to compare the BRA methods within 
      our proposed framework. RESULTS: Unweighted metrics include the number needed to 
      treat and the number needed to harm. Metrics that incorporate preference weights 
      include those that use maximum acceptable risk, those that use 
      relative-value-adjusted life-years, and those that use quality-adjusted 
      life-years. Metrics that use decision makers' weights include the multicriteria 
      decision analysis, the benefit-less-risk analysis, Boers' 3 by 3 table, the 
      Gail/NCI method, and the transparent uniform risk benefit overview. Most BRA 
      methods can be derived as a special case of a generalized formula in which some 
      are mathematically identical. Numerical comparison of methods highlights 
      potential differences in BRA results and their interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed framework provides a unified, patient-centered approach to BRA methods 
      classification based on the types of weights that are used across existing 
      methods, a key differentiating feature.

TI  - User-Driven Strategy for In Silico Screening of Reversed-Phase Liquid 
      Chromatography Conditions for Known Pharmaceutical-Related Small Molecules.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27238306 [doi]
LID - 8306
AB  - In the pharmaceutical field, and more precisely in quality control laboratories, 
      robust liquid chromatographic methods are needed to separate and analyze mixtures 
      of compounds. The development of such chromatographic methods for new mixtures 
      can result in a long and tedious process even while using the design of 
      experiments methodology. However, developments could be accelerated with the help 
      of in silico screening. In this work, the usefulness of a strategy combining 
      response surface methodology (RSM) followed by multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA) applied to predictions from a quantitative structure-retention 
      relationship (QSRR) model is demonstrated. The developed strategy shows that 
      selecting equations for the retention time prediction models based on the pKa of 
      the compound allows flexibility in the models. The MCDA developed is shown to 
      help to make decisions on different criteria while being robust to the user's 
      decision on the weights for each criterion. This strategy is proposed for the 
      screening phase of the method lifecycle. The strategy offers the possibility to 
      the user to select chromatographic conditions based on multiple criteria without 
      being too sensitive to the importance given to them. The conditions with the 
      highest desirability are defined as the starting point for further optimization 
      steps.

TI  - Charting a path for innovative toilet technology using multicriteria decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 1855-62
AB  - Practical and theoretically sound methods for analyzing innovative environmental 
      technologies are needed to inform public and private decisions regarding research 
      and development, risk management, and stakeholder communication. By integrating 
      scientific assessments with a characterization of values, multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) supports the ranking of alternative technology pathways on the 
      basis of technical, financial, and social concerns. We applied MCDAto evaluate 
      the use of NoMix urine separating toilets for managing environmental risk and 
      postponing expensive upgrades to a large wastewater treatment plant near Zürich, 
      Switzerland. Results indicate that, given current priorities, no single, fixed 
      course of action (including the status quo) will be desirable to all stakeholders 
      over the considered time horizon. However, a path forward is suggested that is 
      not significantly disadvantageous to any stakeholder now and leaves open future 
      options, allowing society to achieve overall greater benefits if priorities 
      change, new environmental risks are revealed, or technology improves. While our 
      analysis focuses on a particular catchment in Switzerland, many communities 
      worldwide are faced with an aging and inefficient wastewater treatment 
      infrastructure while also experiencing growth and development. Our framework can 
      help these communities balance the conflicting objectives of diverse stakeholders 
      and gain insight into the role that urine separation can play in transitioning to 
      a more comprehensive and sustainable urban water management system.

TI  - Determining the value contribution of selexipag for the treatment of pulmonary 
      arterial hypertension (PAH) in Spain using reflective multi-criteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA).
PG  - 220

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a chronic rare disease that 
      can lead to serious cardiovascular problems and death. Additional treatments that 
      increase effectiveness, that are safe and with a convenient administration that 
      improve outcomes and quality of life for patients are needed. The aim of this 
      study was to assess the value contribution of the new, oral prostacyclin receptor 
      agonist, selexipag, for PAH treatment in Spain through reflective Multicriteria 
      Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review 
      was performed to develop an evidence matrix, composed of twelve quantitative 
      criteria and four contextual criteria, based on an EVIDEM MCDA framework adapted 
      to orphan drugs evaluation by the Spanish region of Catalonia. Quantitative 
      performance scores, qualitative impact of contextual criteria and individual 
      reflections from stakeholders were collected for each MCDA framework criteria. 
      The value contribution of selexipag to PAH treatment compared to inhaled iloprost 
      was calculated. RESULTS: Oral selexipag for PAH treatment was considered as a 
      treatment which adds value, compared to iloprost, in the following MCDA 
      quantitative criteria: comparative efficacy, patient reported outcomes, 
      preventive benefit, therapeutic benefit, other medical costs and other 
      non-medical costs, without significant differences in safety profile but with a 
      higher acquisition cost than inhaled iloprost. CONCLUSIONS: Selexipag was 
      considered to provide value to PAH treatment. It was perceived as an intervention 
      indicated for a severe rare disease with high unmet needs, supported by high 
      quality clinical evidence. When compared to inhaled iloprost, oral selexipag has 
      demonstrated improvements in efficacy and patient reported outcomes, with a 
      similar safety profile and some additional costs. Reflective MCDA provided a 
      standardised, transparent approach to evaluate multiple criteria relating to the 
      overall value contribution of selexipag to PAH treatment facilitating 
      decision-making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how value is defined and measured in 
      existing value assessment frameworks (VAFs) in healthcare. METHODS: We searched 
      PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 
      from 2008 to 2019. We also performed backward citation chaining of included 
      studies and previously published systematic reviews. Studies reporting the 
      development of a VAF in healthcare were included. For each included framework, we 
      extracted and compared the context, target users, intended use, methods used to 
      identify value attributes, description of the attributes, and attribute scoring 
      approaches. RESULTS: Of the 8151 articles screened, 57 VAFs were included. The 
      value attributes included in 55 VAFs were grouped into 9 categories: health 
      benefits (n = 53, 96%), affordability (n = 45, 82%), societal impact (n = 42, 
      76%), burden of disease (n = 36, 65%), quality of evidence (n = 32, 58%), 
      cost-effectiveness (n = 31, 56%), ethics and equity (n = 27, 49%), unmet needs 
      (n = 21, 38%), and innovation (n = 15, 27%). The remaining 2 VAFs used broad 
      attributes or user-defined attributes. Literature review was the main approach to 
      identify value attributes in 36 VAFs. Patient or public was engaged through the 
      development of only 11 VAFs. Weighting has been used to score 29 VAFs, of which 
      19 used the methods of multicriteria decision analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are 
      substantial variations in defining and measuring value. A noticeable weakness of 
      existing VAFs is that patient or public engagement was generally very limited or 
      missing in framework development process. Existing VAFs tend to aggregate 
      multiple value attributes into a single index for decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This article outlines the Decision-Oriented Health Technology 
      Assessment: a new implementation of the European network for Health Technology 
      Assessment Core Model, integrating the multicriteria decision-making analysis by 
      using the analytic hierarchy process to introduce a standardized methodological 
      approach as a valued and shared tool to support health care decision making 
      within a hospital. METHODS: Following the Core Model as guidance (European 
      network for Health Technology Assessment. HTA core model for medical and surgical 
      interventions. Available from: 
      http://www.eunethta.eu/outputs/hta-core-model-medical-and-surgical-interventions-10r. 
      [Accessed May 27, 2014]), it is possible to apply the analytic hierarchy process 
      to break down a problem into its constituent parts and identify priorities (i.e., 
      assigning a weight to each part) in a hierarchical structure. Thus, it 
      quantitatively compares the importance of multiple criteria in assessing health 
      technologies and how the alternative technologies perform in satisfying these 
      criteria. The verbal ratings are translated into a quantitative form by using the 
      Saaty scale (Saaty TL. Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process. Int J 
      Serv Sci 2008;1:83-98). An eigenvectors analysis is used for deriving the 
      weights' systems (i.e., local and global weights' system) that reflect the 
      importance assigned to the criteria and the priorities related to the performance 
      of the alternative technologies. RESULTS: Compared with the Core Model, this 
      methodological approach supplies a more timely as well as contextualized evidence 
      for a specific technology, making it possible to obtain data that are more 
      relevant and easier to interpret, and therefore more useful for decision makers 
      to make investment choices with greater awareness. CONCLUSIONS: We reached the 
      conclusion that although there may be scope for improvement, this implementation 
      is a step forward toward the goal of building a "solid bridge" between the 
      scientific evidence and the final decision maker's choice.

TI  - Decision Support Tool for Water Reclamation Beyond Technical 
      Considerations-Egyptian, Moroccan, and Tunisian Case Studies.
PG  - 885-897
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4303 [doi]
AB  - While the Middle East and North African (MENA) region is facing challenges to 
      sustain water security, water reclamation has received increasing consideration 
      as a favorable mitigating solution. Despite the availability of adequate 
      technologies, economic, political, legal, social, and environmental constraints 
      often hamper stakeholders, and especially decision makers, from exploiting the 
      existing potential into solution implementation. In the present paper, a 
      comprehensive assessment for water reclamation and reuse was developed. This 
      assessment consisted of 4 objectives: 1) apply a decision-support tool (DST) for 
      water reclamation potential for municipal wastewater, 2) apply a DST for 
      simulating and estimating the lifecycle costs of project-related technologies for 
      water reclamation (municipal and industrial wastewater, as well as drainage canal 
      water), 3) assess the national-level conditions for water reuse with a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCA), and 4) establish exemplary strategies, 
      barriers, and measures for water reuse. The present MCA considered 6 thematic 
      subjects: policy and institution, economy, society, water management, 
      legislation, and environment. The assessment was applied to food and nonfood crop 
      irrigation in Egyptian, Moroccan, and Tunisian case studies. For all defined case 
      studies, adapted treatment trains that could treat wastewater to the desired 
      quality at reasonable costs were identified and are presented in the present 
      paper. Results showed that technological options are available for water reuse, 
      but the concept is not widely implemented in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. The 
      present paper identifies key barriers and drivers for the implementation of water 
      reclamation for irrigation. In particular, the considered countries showed 
      different characteristics regarding efficient water management, water pricing, 
      subsidies and wastewater tariffs, implementation of monitoring and reporting 
      systems, or legal aspects regarding the use of reclaimed water for food crop 
      irrigation. Further exploration of case studies on high potential water reuse and 
      financially affordable wastewater reclamation, particularly case studies that 
      explore the impacts of policies and practices across countries, would be useful 
      for helping the MENA region improve their water security situation. Integr

AB  - Emergency Management and Operations (EMO) personnel are in need of resources and 
      tools to assist in understanding the health risks associated with dermal 
      exposures during chemical incidents. This article reviews available resources and 
      presents a conceptual framework for a decision support system (DSS) that assists 
      in characterizing and managing risk during chemical emergencies involving dermal 
      exposures. The framework merges principles of three decision-making techniques: 
      1) scenario planning, 2) risk analysis, and 3) multicriteria decision analysis 
      (MCDA). This DSS facilitates dynamic decision making during each of the distinct 
      life cycle phases of an emergency incident (ie, preparedness, response, or 
      recovery) and identifies EMO needs. A checklist tool provides key questions 
      intended to guide users through the complexities of conducting a dermal risk 
      assessment. The questions define the scope of the framework for resource 
      identification and application to support decision-making needs. The framework 
      consists of three primary modules: 1) resource compilation, 2) prioritization, 
      and 3) decision. The modules systematically identify, organize, and rank relevant 
      information resources relating to the hazards of dermal exposures to chemicals 
      and risk management strategies. Each module is subdivided into critical elements 
      designed to further delineate the resources based on relevant incident phase and 
      type of information. The DSS framework provides a much needed structure based on 
      contemporary decision analysis principles for 1) documenting key questions for 
      EMO problem formulation and 2) a method for systematically organizing, screening, 
      and prioritizing information resources on dermal hazards, exposures, risk 
      characterization, and management.

TI  - A Framework for the Selection of Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria Based on 
      Bacterial Competence Mechanisms.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00760-20 [doi]
LID - e00760-20
AB  - The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is increasingly meaningful 
      for the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. 
      However, often the PGPR strains selected in the laboratory fail to confer the 
      expected beneficial effects when evaluated in plant experiments. Insufficient 
      rhizosphere colonization is pointed out as one of the causes. With the aim of 
      minimizing this inconsistency, we propose that besides studying plant growth 
      promotion traits (PGP), the screening strategy should include evaluation of the 
      microbial phenotypes required for colonization and persistence. As a model, we 
      carried out this strategy in three Rhizobium sp. strains that showed phosphorus 
      solubilization ability and production of siderophores. All strains displayed 
      colonization phenotypes like surface spreading, resistance to hydrogen peroxide, 
      and formed biofilms. Regarding their ability to persist, biofilm formation was 
      observed to be influenced by pH and the phosphorus nutrient provided in the 
      growth media. Differences in the competence of the strains to use several carbon 
      substrates were also detected. As part of our framework, we compared the 
      phenotypic characteristics of the strains in a quantitative manner. The data 
      analysis was integrated using a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). All our 
      results were scored, weighted, and grouped as relevant for PGP, colonization, or 
      persistence. MCDA demonstrated that, when the phenotypes related to PGP and 
      colonization are weighted over those for persistence, strain B02 performs better 
      than the other two Rhizobium sp. strains. The use of our framework could assist 
      the selection of more competent strains to be tested in greenhouse and field 
      trials.IMPORTANCE Numerous plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been 
      inoculated into the soil with the aim of improving the supply of nutrients to 
      crop plants and decreasing the requirement of chemical fertilizers. However, 
      sometimes these microbes fail to competitively colonize the plant roots and 
      rhizosphere. Hence, the plant growth promotion effect is not observed. Here, we 
      describe a new screening strategy aiming at the selection of more competent PGPR. 
      We evaluated bacterial phenotypes related to plant growth promotion, 
      colonization, and persistence. Our results demonstrated that despite the fact 
      that our Rhizobium sp. strains successfully solubilized phosphorus and produced 
      siderophores, their abilities to spread over surfaces, resist hydrogen peroxide, 
      and form biofilms varied. Additionally, a multicriteria decision analysis was 
      used to analyze the data that originated from bacterial physiological 
      characterizations. This analysis allowed us to innovatively evaluate each strain 
      as a whole and compare the performances of the strains under hypothetical 
      scenarios of bacterial-trait requirements.

TI  - Barriers for Access to New Medicines: Searching for the Balance Between Rising 
      Costs and Limited Budgets.

AB  - Introduction: There is continued unmet medical need for new medicines across 
      countries especially for cancer, immunological diseases, and orphan diseases. 
      However, there are growing challenges with funding new medicines at ever 
      increasing prices along with funding increased medicine volumes with the growth 
      in both infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases across countries. This 
      has resulted in the development of new models to better manage the entry of new 
      medicines, new financial models being postulated to finance new medicines as well 
      as strategies to improve prescribing efficiency. However, more needs to be done. 
      Consequently, the primary aim of this paper is to consider potential ways to 
      optimize the use of new medicines balancing rising costs with increasing 
      budgetary pressures to stimulate debate especially from a payer perspective. 
      Methods: A narrative review of pharmaceutical policies and implications, as well 
      as possible developments, based on key publications and initiatives known to the 
      co-authors principally from a health authority perspective. Results: A number of 
      initiatives and approaches have been identified including new models to better 
      manage the entry of new medicines based on three pillars (pre-, peri-, and 
      post-launch activities). Within this, we see the growing role of horizon scanning 
      activities starting up to 36 months before launch, managed entry agreements and 
      post launch follow-up. It is also likely there will be greater scrutiny over the 
      effectiveness and value of new cancer medicines given ever increasing prices. 
      This could include establishing minimum effectiveness targets for premium pricing 
      along with re-evaluating prices as more medicines for cancer lose their patent. 
      There will also be a greater involvement of patients especially with orphan 
      diseases. New initiatives could include a greater role of multicriteria decision 
      analysis, as well as looking at the potential for de-linking research and 
      development from commercial activities to enhance affordability. Conclusion: 
      There are a number of ongoing activities across countries to try and fund new 
      valued medicines whilst attaining or maintaining universal healthcare. Such 
      activities will grow with increasing resource pressures and continued unmet need.

TI  - Patient priorities in colorectal cancer screening decisions.
PG  - 334-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the United States recommend 
      that decisions about screening should incorporate patient preferences, but little 
      is known about how patients make the trade-offs inherent in choosing one of the 
      five currently recommended screening programmes. STUDY POPULATION: Forty-eight 
      primary care patients at average risk for colorectal cancer who completed an 
      experimental shared decision-making intervention based on a multicriteria 
      decision analysis. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of priorities assigned to 
      decision criteria describing the advantages and disadvantages of the five 
      currently recommended colorectal screening programmes in the United States. 
      Criteria were divided into four major criteria - avoid cancer, avoid screening 
      side-effects, avoid false positive test results and the combined importance of 
      other considerations - and three subcriteria: the number of screening tests, test 
      preparation and the test itself. Cluster analysis was used to identify common 
      combinations of priorities within each set of criteria. RESULTS: Patients 
      assigned widely variable priorities to both the criteria and subcriteria: the 
      average range of priorities was 46 on a 100 point priority scale. Cluster 
      analysis identified six different combinations of priorities for the major 
      criteria and four for the subcriteria. The differences in priorities assigned to 
      both the criteria and subcriteria in the clusters were statistically significant 
      with P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Even within a small group of patients, preferences 
      vary widely regarding trade-offs involved in choosing among the currently 
      recommended colorectal cancer screening programmes in the United States. These 
      results provide empiric support for recommendations to utilize a shared 
      decision-making process when making colorectal cancer screening decisions and 
      highlight the need for additional research into how average risk patients view 
      the trade-offs inherent in choosing a colorectal cancer screening programme.

LID - 987298
AB  - Psychotics disorders, most commonly known as schizophrenia, have incapacitated 
      professionals in different sectors of activities. Those disorders have caused 
      damage in a microlevel to the individual and his/her family and in a macrolevel 
      to the economic and production system of the country. The lack of early and 
      sometimes very late diagnosis has provided reactive measures, when the 
      professional is already showing psychological signs of incapacity to work. This 
      study aims to help the early diagnosis of psychotics' disorders with a hybrid 
      proposal of an expert system that is integrated to structured methodologies in 
      decision support (multicriteria decision analysis: MCDA) and knowledge structured 
      representations into production rules and probabilities (artificial intelligence: 
      AI).

TI  - Modified QuEChERS Method for Extracting Thiamethoxam and Imidacloprid from 
      Stingless Bees: Development, Application, and Green Metrics.
PG  - 2365-2374
LID - 10.1002/etc.5419 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, a method for the determination of residues of the 
      neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in the stingless bee 
      Melipona scutellaris Latreille (1811) was optimized through a factorial design, 
      tested using green metrics, and then applied to exposed bees. It combines the 
      extraction with a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method 
      and the determination by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. 
      Different parameters such as the mass of the sample, dispersive sorbents, and 
      elution solvents were assessed. Method validation parameters were checked and 
      include sensitivity, specificity, and linearity. The limit of quantification of 
      0.0025 μg g(-1) was obtained for both insecticides, where accuracy was 94%-100% 
      with satisfactory intraday and interday precisions (relative standard 
      deviation <10%). The qualified method was applied to orally and topically exposed 
      bee samples, and the results indicated that it is suitable for the determination 
      and quantification of neonicotinoid pesticide residues in this species. Moreover, 
      green analytical metrics like the National Environmental Methods Index, Eco Scale 
      score, high-performance liquid chromatography with an environmental assessment 
      tool (HPLC-EAT), waste generation, and amount of sample were compared with 
      methods described in the literature involving neonicotinoid analysis in 
      honeybees. As a result, the present study displayed the highest Eco Scale score 
      and HPLC-EAT score and the second smallest amount of sample and waste generated. 
      Thus, the method meets green analytical metrics more than other methods. In this 
      sense, besides the application, the multicriteria decision analysis tool employed 
      suggests that this is a good option as a green analytical method. Environ Toxicol

TI  - Risk ranking of food categories associated with Salmonella enterica contamination 
      in the central region of Mexico.
LID - 10.1111/risa.13907 [doi]
AB  - To prevent and control foodborne diseases, there is a fundamental need to 
      identify the foods that are most likely to cause illness. The goal of this study 
      was to rank 25 commonly consumed food products associated with Salmonella 
      enterica contamination in the Central Region of Mexico. A multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) framework was developed to obtain an S. enterica risk score for 
      each food product based on four criteria: probability of exposure to S. enterica 
      through domestic food consumption (Se); S. enterica growth potential during home 
      storage (Sg); per capita consumption (Pcc); and food attribution of S. enterica 
      outbreak (So). Risk scores were calculated by the equation Se*W(1) +Sg*W(2) 
      +Pcc*W(3) +So*W(4) , where each criterion was assigned a normalized value (1-5) 
      and the relative weights (W) were defined by 22 experts' opinion. Se had the 
      largest effect on the risk score being the criterion with the highest weight 
      (35%; IC95% 20%-60%), followed by So (24%; 5%-50%), Sg (23%; 10%-40%), and Pcc 
      (18%; 10%-35%). The results identified chicken (4.4 ± 0.6), pork (4.2 ± 0.6), and 
      beef (4.2 ± 0.5) as the highest risk foods, followed by seed fruits (3.6 ± 0.5), 
      tropical fruits (3.4 ± 0.4), and dried fruits and nuts (3.4 ± 0.5), while the 
      food products with the lowest risk were yogurt (2.1 ± 0.3), chorizo (2.1 ± 0.4), 
      and cream (2.0 ± 0.3). Approaches with expert-based weighting and equal weighting 
      showed good correlation (R(2 ) = 0.96) and did not show significant differences 
      among the ranking order in the top 20 tier. This study can help risk managers 
      select interventions and develop targeted surveillance programs against S. 
      enterica in high-risk food products.

TI  - Improved survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients after introducing 
      patient navigation: A retrospective cohort study with propensity score weighted 
      historic control.

AB  - OnkoNetwork is a patient navigation program established in the Moritz Kaposi 
      General Hospital to improve the timeliness and completeness of cancer 
      investigations and treatment. The H2020 SELFIE consortium selected OnkoNetwork as 
      a promising integrated care initiative in Hungary and conducted a multicriteria 
      decision analysis based on health, patient experience, and cost outcomes. In this 
      paper, a more detailed analysis of clinical impacts is provided in the largest 
      subgroup, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A retrospective cohort 
      study was conducted, enrolling new cancer suspect patients with subsequently 
      confirmed NSCLC in two annual periods, before and after OnkoNetwork 
      implementation (control and intervention cohorts, respectively). To control for 
      selection bias and confounding, baseline balance was improved via propensity 
      score weighting. Overall survival was analyzed in univariate and multivariate 
      weighted Cox regression models and the effect was further characterized in a 
      counterfactual analysis. Our analysis included 123 intervention and 173 control 
      NSCLC patients from early to advanced stage, with significant between-cohort 
      baseline differences. The propensity score-based weighting resulted in good 
      baseline balance. A large survival benefit was observed in the intervention 
      cohort, and intervention was an independent predictor of longer survival in a 
      multivariate analysis when all baseline characteristics were included (HR = 0.63, 
      p = 0.039). When post-baseline variables were included in the model, belonging to 
      the intervention cohort was not an independent predictor of survival, but the 
      survival benefit was explained by slightly better stage distribution and ECOG 
      status at treatment initiation, together with trends for broader use of PET-CT 
      and higher resectability rate. In conclusion, patient navigation is a valuable 
      tool to improve cancer outcomes by facilitating more timely and complete cancer 
      diagnostics. Contradictory evidence in the literature may be explained by common 
      sources of bias, including the wait-time paradox and adjustment to intermediate 
      outcomes.

AB  - Decisions about energy backup and cooling options for parabolic trough (PT) 
      concentrated solar power have technical, economic, and environmental 
      implications. Although PT development has increased rapidly in recent years, 
      energy policies do not address backup or cooling option requirements, and very 
      few studies directly compare the diverse implications of these options. This is 
      the first study to compare the annual capacity factor, levelized cost of energy 
      (LCOE), water consumption, land use, and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) 
      emissions of PT with different backup options (minimal backup (MB), thermal 
      energy storage (TES), and fossil fuel backup (FF)) and different cooling options 
      (wet (WC) and dry (DC). Multicriteria decision analysis was used with five 
      preference scenarios to identify the highest-scoring energy backup-cooling 
      combination for each preference scenario. MB-WC had the highest score in the 
      Economic and Climate Change-Economy scenarios, while FF-DC and FF-WC had the 
      highest scores in the Equal and Availability scenarios, respectively. TES-DC had 
      the highest score for the Environmental scenario. DC was ranked 1-3 in all 
      preference scenarios. Direct comparisons between GHG emissions and LCOE and 
      between GHG emissions and land use suggest a preference for TES if backup is 
      require for PT plants to compete with baseload generators.

AB  - The longitudinal dimension of river connectivity has been significantly disrupted 
      by barriers to compensate for water demand in the long periods of water scarcity 
      in the Iberian Peninsula. The scale of this modification is widespread in the 
      Portuguese part of Douro River network where, side to side with agriculture water 
      demand, there is a constant increase in hydropower production. Thus, native 
      species in Iberian freshwater systems, performing reproductive migrations along 
      the rivers, are strongly affected by the amplification of fragmentation caused by 
      the tremendous density of transversal obstacles in this river basin. We aimed to 
      prioritize dam removal in the Portuguese part of Douro River, mainly considering 
      obsolete barriers (small dams, weirs) based on a spatial multicriteria decision 
      analysis (GIS-MCDA) based on a prioritization procedure. A diversity of 
      parameters were used to prioritize (rank) the dam's suitability for removal, 
      considering the losses of connectivity and fish biodiversity, habitat 
      degradation, negative effects on water quality and ecological conditions, and 
      socio-economic factors. Different weights were assigned to the different 
      attributes in each criterion according to their importance. The analysis also 
      included a significant constraint: the potential spreading of exotic invasive 
      fish species if connection was reestablished through dam removal. This procedure 
      started with the georeferencing of 1201 transversal obstacles that were further 
      characterized for their relative permeability to fish migration. In conclusion 
      the model used allowed to identify 158 priority barriers, as well as the 5 most 
      fragmented tributaries, which means the most impacted by river regulation. In 8 
      cases the barriers were big dams (> 15 m), whereas in the remaining 150 were 
      weirs. From a final rank of 20 most impacting structures, the MCDA results also 
      identified two cases where potential removal could trigger the additional impact 
      to native fish species related to the sprawl of alien populations.

TI  - Application of Graph Theory to Cost-Effective Fire Protection of Chemical Plants 
      During Domino Effects.
PG  - 1652-1667
LID - 10.1111/risa.12712 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we have introduced a methodology based on graph theory and 
      multicriteria decision analysis for cost-effective fire protection of chemical 
      plants subject to fire-induced domino effects. By modeling domino effects in 
      chemical plants as a directed graph, the graph centrality measures such as 
      out-closeness and betweenness scores can be used to identify the installations 
      playing a key role in initiating and propagating potential domino effects. It is 
      demonstrated that active fire protection of installations with the highest 
      out-closeness score and passive fire protection of installations with the highest 
      betweenness score are the most effective strategies for reducing the 
      vulnerability of chemical plants to fire-induced domino effects. We have employed 
      a dynamic graph analysis to investigate the impact of both the availability and 
      the degradation of fire protection measures over time on the vulnerability of 
      chemical plants. The results obtained from the graph analysis can further be 
      prioritized using multicriteria decision analysis techniques such as the method 
      of reference point to find the most cost-effective fire protection strategy.

TI  - Value assessment of oncology drugs using a weighted criterion-based approach.
PG  - 1530-1540
LID - 10.1002/cncr.32639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, the rising cost of anticancer therapy has motivated efforts 
      to quantify the overall value of new cancer treatments. Multicriteria decision 
      analysis offers a novel approach to incorporate multiple criteria and 
      perspectives into value assessment. METHODS: The authors recruited a diverse, 
      multistakeholder group who identified and weighted key criteria to establish the 
      drug assessment framework (DAF). Construct validity assessed the degree to which 
      DAF scores were associated with past pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) 
      funding recommendations and European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of 
      Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS; version 1.1) scores. RESULTS: The final DAF 
      included 10 criteria: overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, 
      quality of life, toxicity, unmet need, equity, feasibility, disease severity, and 
      caregiver well-being. The first 5 clinical benefit criteria represent 
      approximately 64% of the total weight. DAF scores ranged from 0 to 300, 
      reflecting both the expected impact of the drug and the quality of supporting 
      evidence. When the DAF was applied to the last 60 drugs (with reviewers blinded) 
      reviewed by pCODR (2015-2018), those drugs with positive pCODR funding 
      recommendations were found to have higher DAF scores compared with drugs not 
      recommended (103 vs 63; Student t test P = .0007). DAF clinical benefit criteria 
      mildly correlated with ESMO-MCBS scores (correlation coefficient, 0.33; 95% CI, 
      0.009-0.59). Sensitivity analyses that varied the criteria scores did not change 
      the results. CONCLUSIONS: Using a structured and explicit approach, a 
      criterion-based valuation framework was designed to provide a transparent and 
      consistent method with which to value and prioritize cancer drugs to facilitate 
      the delivery of affordable cancer care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although regulatory authorities evaluate the risks and benefits of any 
      new drug therapy during the new drug-approval process, quantitative risk-benefit 
      assessment (RBA) is not typically performed, nor is it presented in a consistent 
      and integrated framework when it is used. Our purpose is to identify and describe 
      published quantitative RBA methods for pharmaceuticals. METHODS: Using MEDLINE 
      and other Internet-based search engines, a systematic literature review was 
      performed to identify quantitative methodologies for RBA. These distinct RBA 
      approaches were summarized to highlight the implications of their differences for 
      the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. RESULTS: Theoretical models, 
      parameters, and key features were reviewed and compared for the 12 quantitative 
      RBA methods identified in the literature, including the Quantitative Framework 
      for Risk and Benefit Assessment, benefit-less-risk analysis, the quality-adjusted 
      time without symptoms and toxicity, number needed to treat (NNT), and number 
      needed to harm and their relative-value-adjusted versions, minimum clinical 
      efficacy, incremental net health benefit, the risk-benefit plane (RBP), the 
      probabilistic simulation method, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), the 
      risk-benefit contour (RBC), and the stated preference method (SPM). Whereas some 
      approaches (e.g., NNT) rely on subjective weighting schemes or nonstatistical 
      assessments, other methods (e.g., RBP, MCDA, RBC, and SPM) assess joint 
      distributions of benefit and risk. CONCLUSIONS: Several quantitative RBA methods 
      are available that could be used to help lessen concern over subjective drug 
      assessments and to help guide authorities toward more objective and transparent 
      decision-making. When evaluating a new drug therapy, we recommend the use of 
      multiple RBA approaches across different therapeutic indications and treatment 
      populations in order to bound the risk-benefit profile.

TI  - Surveillance of foodborne parasitic diseases in Europe in a One Health approach.
PG  - e00205

LID - e00205
AB  - In 2012, WHO/FAO ranked 24 foodborne parasites (FBP) using multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) to provide risk assessors with a basis for prioritising control 
      of highly ranked FBP on the global level. One conclusion was that ranking may 
      differ substantially per region. In Europe, the same methodology was used to rank 
      FBP of relevance for Europe. Of the 24 FBP, the top-five prioritised FBP were 
      identified for Europe as Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxoplasma gondii, 
      Trichinella spiralis, E. granulosus, and Cryptosporidium spp., all of which are 
      zoonotic. The objective of the present study was to provide an overview of 
      surveillance and reporting systems in Europe for these top five prioritised FBP 
      in the human and animal populations, to identify gaps, and give recommendations 
      for improvement. Information on the surveillance systems was collected from 35 
      European countries and analysed according to the five different regions. For most 
      FBP, human surveillance is passive in most countries and regions in Europe and 
      notification differs between countries and regions. Adequate surveillance 
      programmes for these FBP are lacking, except for T. spiralis, which is notifiable 
      in 34 countries with active surveillance in susceptible animals under EU 
      directive. Although human and animal surveillance data are available for the five 
      prioritised FBP, we identified a lack of consistency in surveillance and 
      reporting requirements between national experts and European bodies. 
      Recommendations for improved surveillance systems are discussed.

TI  - Enabling Stakeholder Involvement in Coastal Disaster Resilience Planning.
PG  - 1181-1200
LID - 10.1111/risa.12737 [doi]
AB  - Coastal hazards including storm surge, sea-level rise, and cyclone winds continue 
      to have devastating effects on infrastructure systems and communities despite 
      costly investments in risk management. Risk management has generally not been 
      sufficiently focused on coastal resilience, with community stakeholders involved 
      in the process of making their coastline, as a system, more resilient to coastal 
      storms. Thus, without stakeholder earlier involvement in coastal resilience 
      planning for their community, they are frustrated after disasters occur. The U.S. 
      National Academies has defined resilience as "the ability to prepare and plan 
      for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse 
      events"(National Research Council). This article introduces a methodology for 
      enabling stakeholder-involved resilience discussions across physical, 
      information, cognitive, and social domains. The methodology addresses the stages 
      of resilience-prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt-and integrates performance 
      assessment with scenario analysis to characterize disruptions of risk-management 
      priorities. The methodology is illustrated through a case study at Mobile Bay, 
      Alabama, USA.

TI  - Estimating solid waste generation and suitability analysis of landfill sites 
      using regression, geospatial, and remote sensing techniques in Rangpur, 
      Bangladesh.
PG  - 54
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10695-4 [doi]
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been a growing problem in 
      fast-developing cities. A considerable amount of solid waste is generated daily 
      and disposed anywhere, which creates an unhealthy environment. This study aims to 
      develop a model to determine household solid waste (HSW) generation using 
      multiple linear regression and identify suitable landfill sites to ensure proper 
      MSW disposal in Rangpur City, Bangladesh. Socioeconomic variables data like 
      average monthly income, educational level, family size, age of family head, and 
      average HSW generation per day were collected from 381 respondents through 
      stratified random sampling with a 95% confidence level. Multi-criteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) was performed using variables like surface water, slope, road 
      network, and land use through GIS and remote sensing to find suitable landfill 
      sites. Results of the model show no multicollinearity as the variance inflation 
      factor was estimated to be less than 2 for each independent variable. 
      Furthermore, the model provides a moderate overall fit because of the coefficient 
      of determination (R(2) = 0.661), which denotes the independent variables' 
      predictive capability. The results also demonstrate that family size and 
      education are the most critical variables in predicting waste generation because 
      of the values of coefficients 122.39 and - 184.72, respectively. This study also 
      illustrated suitable landfill sites through MCDA, which can be a useful resource 
      for the city authority to ensure environmental sustainability by implementing 
      effective strategies for proper MSW management.

TI  - Combining in Silico Tools with Multicriteria Analysis for Alternatives Assessment 
      of Hazardous Chemicals: A Case Study of Decabromodiphenyl Ether Alternatives.
PG  - 6341-6351
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.8b07163 [doi]
AB  - Alternatives assessment is applied for minimizing the risk of unintentionally 
      replacing a hazardous chemical with another hazardous chemical. Central 
      challenges are the diversity of properties to consider and the lack of 
      high-quality experimental data. To address this, a novel alternatives assessment 
      procedure was developed based on in silico data and multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) methods. As a case study, 16 alternatives to the flame retardant 
      decabromodiphenyl ether were considered. The hazard properties included 
      persistence (P), bioaccumulation potential (B), toxicities (T), and mobility in 
      water (M). Databases were consulted and 2866 experimental data points were 
      collected for the target chemicals; however, these were mostly replicate data 
      points for some hazard criteria for a subset of alternatives. Therefore, in 
      silico data and three MCDA strategies were tested including heat mapping, 
      multiattribute utility theory (MAUT), and Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la 
      REalité (ELECTRE III). The heat map clearly showed that none of the target 
      chemicals are hazard-free, whereas MAUT and ELECTRE III agreed on ranking the 
      "least worst" choices. This study identified several challenges and the 
      complexity in the alternatives assessment processes motivating more case studies 
      combining in silico and MCDA approaches.

TI  - From efficacy to equity: Literature review of decision criteria for resource 
      allocation and healthcare decisionmaking.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1478-7547-10-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Resource allocation is a challenging issue faced by health policy 
      decisionmakers requiring careful consideration of many factors. Objectives of 
      this study were to identify decision criteria and their frequency reported in the 
      literature on healthcare decisionmaking. METHOD: An extensive literature search 
      was performed in Medline and EMBASE to identify articles reporting healthcare 
      decision criteria. Studies conducted with decisionmakers (e.g., focus groups, 
      surveys, interviews), conceptual and review articles and articles describing 
      multicriteria tools were included. Criteria were extracted, organized using a 
      classification system derived from the EVIDEM framework and applying 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, and the frequency of their 
      occurrence was measured. RESULTS: Out of 3146 records identified, 2790 were 
      excluded. Out of 356 articles assessed for eligibility, 40 studies included. 
      Criteria were identified from studies performed in several regions of the world 
      involving decisionmakers at micro, meso and macro levels of decision and from 
      studies reporting on multicriteria tools. Large variations in terminology used to 
      define criteria were observed and 360 different terms were identified. These were 
      assigned to 58 criteria which were classified in 9 different categories 
      including: health outcomes; types of benefit; disease impact; therapeutic 
      context; economic impact; quality of evidence; implementation complexity; 
      priority, fairness and ethics; and overall context. The most frequently mentioned 
      criteria were: equity/fairness (32 times), efficacy/effectiveness (29), 
      stakeholder interests and pressures (28), cost-effectiveness (23), strength of 
      evidence (20), safety (19), mission and mandate of health system (19), 
      organizational requirements and capacity (17), patient-reported outcomes (17) and 
      need (16). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of considering both 
      normative and feasibility criteria for fair allocation of resources and optimized 
      decisionmaking for coverage and use of healthcare interventions. This analysis 
      provides a foundation to develop a questionnaire for an international survey of 
      decisionmakers on criteria and their relative importance. The ultimate objective 
      is to develop sound multicriteria approaches to enlighten healthcare 
      decisionmaking and priority-setting.

      emerging diseases for which medical countermeasures are insufficient or 
      nonexistent. The prioritization process has 3 components: a Delphi process to 
      narrow down a list of potential priority diseases, a multicriteria decision 
      analysis to rank the short list of diseases, and a final Delphi round to arrive 
      at a final list of 10 diseases. A group of international experts applied this 
      process in January 2017, resulting in a list of 10 priority diseases. The 
      robustness of the list was tested by performing a sensitivity analysis. The new 
      process corrected major shortcomings in the pre-R&D Blueprint approach to disease 
      prioritization and increased confidence in the results.

TI  - Decision-making criteria among national policymakers in five countries: a 
      discrete choice experiment eliciting relative preferences for equity and 
      efficiency.
PG  - 534-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2012.04.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, there is a need for formalization of the priority setting 
      processes in health. Recent research has used the term multicriteria decision 
      analysis for methods that systematically include preferences for both equity and 
      efficiency. The present study compares decision-makers' preferences at the 
      country level for a set of equity and efficiency criteria according to a 
      multicriteria decision analysis framework. METHODS: Discrete choice experiments 
      were conducted for Brazil, Cuba, Nepal, Norway, and Uganda. By using standardized 
      methods, we elicited preferences for intervention attributes using a individual 
      choice questionnaire. A multinomial logistic regression was applied to estimate 
      the coefficients for all single-policy criteria, per country. Attributes were 
      assigned to an equity group or to an efficiency group. After testing for scale 
      variance, predicted probabilities for interventions with both types of attributes 
      were compared across countries. RESULTS: The Norway and Nepal groups showed 
      considerable preferences for efficiency criteria over equity criteria with 
      percent change in respective predicted sum probabilities of [10%, -84%] and [6%, 
      -79%]. Brazil and Uganda also showed preference for the efficiency criteria 
      though less convincingly ([-34%, -93%], [-18%, -63%], respectively). The Cuban 
      group showed the strongest preferences with equity attributes dominating 
      efficiency ([-52%, 213%]). CONCLUSIONS: Group preferences of policymakers show 
      explicit but varying trade-offs of efficiency and equity in these diverse 
      settings. This multicriteria decision analysis approach, using discrete choice 
      experiments, indicates that systematic setting of health priorities is possible 
      across a variety of countries. It may be a valuable tool to guide health reform 
      initiatives.

TI  - Recommendation for a Pilot MCDA Tool to Support the Value-Based Purchasing of 
      Generic Medicines in the UAE.
PG  - 680737
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.680737 [doi]
LID - 680737
AB  - Introduction: In recent periods the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has strengthened 
      economic measures in its pharmaceutical policy by promoting local manufacturing 
      and facilitating the use of generic medicines. International examples indicate 
      the importance of quality control elements in the implementation of cost 
      containment policies. Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used 
      in health care to facilitate health care decision based on multiple objectives. 
      Our objective was to develop a pilot MCDA tool for repeated use to support the 
      value-based purchasing of generic medicines in the UAE. Methods: An international 
      evidence framework was adapted to UAE in a multistakeholder workshop organized by 
      Dubai Health Authority. After validating the relevance of nine criteria in the 
      local jurisdiction, participants decided the ranking and weight of each criterion 
      by anonymous voting. Results: The top four criteria focused on quality elements 
      starting with real-world clinical or economic outcomes (with 19.8% weight), 
      followed by the quality assurance of manufacturing (17.3%), then evidence on the 
      equivalence with the original product (14.8%), and drug formulation and stability 
      (12.3%). The pharmaceutical acquisition cost criteria ranked fifth with 9.4% 
      weight. The bottom four criteria, including reliability of drug supply, 
      macroeconomic benefit, pharmacovigilance and added value services related to the 
      product had similar weights in the range of 5.5-7.7%. Conclusion: Policy-makers 
      in Dubai put high emphasis of value-based health care by incentivizing 
      manufacturers of off-patent pharmaceuticals to generate additional scientific 
      evidence compared to the mandatory minimum and acknowledging efforts to improve 
      quality standards. The MCDA tool is considered suitable to improve the 
      transparency and consistency of decision making in UAE for off-patent 
      pharmaceuticals, and subsequently for other health technologies.

TI  - DESYRE: DEcision Support sYstem for the REhabilitation of contaminated megasites.
PG  - 211-22
AB  - DESYRE (DEcision Support sYstem for the REqualification of contaminated sites) is 
      a GIS-based decision support system (DSS) specifically developed to address the 
      integrated management and remediation of contaminated megasites (i.e., large 
      contaminated areas or impacted areas characterized by multiple site owners and 
      multiple stakeholders). In the DESYRE conceptual design and development the main 
      aspects pertaining to a remediation process--analysis of social and economic 
      benefits and constrains, site characterization, risk assessment, selection of 
      best available technologies, creation of sets of technologies to be applied, 
      analysis of the residual risk, and comparison of different remediation 
      scenarios--were included. The DESYRE DSS is a GIS-based software composed of 6 
      interconnected modules. In the characterization module, chemical and 
      hydrogeological data are organized in a relational database and contaminants' 
      distributions are mapped by using geostatistic tools. The socioeconomic module 
      addresses the socioeconomic constraints though a fuzzy logic analysis to select 
      the best land use. The risk assessment module is divided into 2 phases. In the 
      preremediation phase, an original procedure allows assessing and representing the 
      spatial distribution of risks posed by contaminants in soil and groundwater, 
      providing a risk-based zoning of the site. Then, in the technology assessment 
      module, a selection of suitable technologies and creation of different technology 
      sets, taking into account both technical requirements and site-specific features, 
      are performed by experts supported by multicriteria decision analysis tools. In 
      the postremediation risk assessment, a simulation of applied technologies 
      provides residual risk maps with related uncertainty maps. Finally, in the 
      decision module, alternative remediation scenarios are described by a set of 
      indices and can be compared and ranked by interested stakeholders using 
      multicriteria decision analysis methodologies. The paper highlights original 
      procedural steps and functionalities of DESYRE nd analyzes its main points of 
      strength and potentialities, as well as limits.

AB  - The ecological functions restoration in agricultural areas is a major challenge 
      on a landscape scale. In the specific case of active restoration through 
      Agroforestry Systems (AFS), the absence of a specific direction hinders 
      ecological restoration processes, especially in regions that prefer intensive 
      agriculture. Thus, this study aims to develop a Spatial Indicator of Priority 
      Areas to guide Agroforestry Systems implementation in agricultural landscapes. A 
      spatial multicriteria decision analysis (MDCA) was carried out based on 
      environmental factors: soil, geology and slope (which determine the natural 
      vulnerability of the land) and anthropogenic factors: land use and land cover, 
      forest fragments, potential land use capacity and legal protected areas in rural 
      properties (which reflects human pressure and land use suitability). 
      Subsequently, four priority levels were classified for agroforestry 
      interventions: (1) Low priority; (2) Average priority; (3) High priority; (4) 
      Extreme priority. A final map was made to identify priority areas for landscape 
      recovery in 9 cities located at the mouth of the Mogi Guaçu River Hydrographic 
      Basin, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Considering the natural vulnerability of the 
      land and the multifunctional aspects of the landscape, the scenarios projection 
      allowed a consensus for forest conservation and agricultural suitability 
      perspectives. A final combination of the explored aspects culminated in the 
      spatial indicator, which model foresees 22,300 ha available for urgent actions 
      for restoration, reforestation and sustainable exploitation through agroforestry 
      systems. We emphasize the challenges in reconciling the socioeconomic and 
      ecological functions in the agroecosystem, however, the metric provides a more 
      inclusive and assertive management strategy for natural resources and advances 
      towards the goal of reforestation and implementation of payment for environmental 
      services (PES) schemes.

PG  - 1317-35
LID - 10.1111/risa.12357 [doi]
AB  - Probability elicitation protocols are used to assess and incorporate subjective 
      probabilities in risk and decision analysis. While most of these protocols use 
      methods that have focused on the precision of the elicited probabilities, the 
      speed of the elicitation process has often been neglected. However, speed is also 
      important, particularly when experts need to examine a large number of events on 
      a recurrent basis. Furthermore, most existing elicitation methods are numerical 
      in nature, but there are various reasons why an expert would refuse to give such 
      precise ratio-scale estimates, even if highly numerate. This may occur, for 
      instance, when there is lack of sufficient hard evidence, when assessing very 
      uncertain events (such as emergent threats), or when dealing with politicized 
      topics (such as terrorism or disease outbreaks). In this article, we adopt an 
      ordinal ranking approach from multicriteria decision analysis to provide a fast 
      and nonnumerical probability elicitation process. Probabilities are subsequently 
      approximated from the ranking by an algorithm based on the principle of maximum 
      entropy, a rule compatible with the ordinal information provided by the expert. 
      The method can elicit probabilities for a wide range of different event types, 
      including new ways of eliciting probabilities for stochastically independent 
      events and low-probability events. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to test the 
      accuracy of the approximated probabilities and try the method in practice, 
      applying it to a real-world risk analysis recently conducted for DEFRA (the U.K. 
      Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs): the prioritization of 
      animal health threats.

TI  - Factors Determining Suitable Landfill Sites for Energy Generation from Municipal 
      Solid Waste: A Case Study of Jabodetabek Area, Indonesia.
PG  - 9184786
LID - 10.1155/2022/9184786 [doi]
LID - 9184786
AB  - Most municipal solid waste (MSW) is found to be dominated by organic debris, 
      which has excellent potential as an energy source. However, the main problems of 
      this material are poor planning, urban expansion, and lack of management skills. 
      All these problems are presently being encountered by the regional governments of 
      Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi city (known locally as Jabodetabek), 
      Indonesia. In the MSW management system, a vital planning protocol is reportedly 
      assessing suitable landfill sites for energy generation, although this selection 
      process is still a complex task that should consider various factors, such as 
      environmental, social and safety, and economic variables. Therefore, this study 
      aims to examine various factors in determining a suitable location for landfills. 
      It also aims to identify the various factors required for MSW energy generation. 
      Based on this study, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was 
      applied to weigh the factors determining the appropriate location. This approach 
      is popular in decision-making due to evaluating the complexity of 
      multidimensionality factors. The results showed that 3 factors and 14 subfactors 
      were formulated and structured in the MCDA hierarchy, with their information 
      obtained to create pairwise comparisons by 10 involved experts. In this study, 
      the MCDA output was the weight value associated with a systematic priority level, 
      indicating that the environment was the highest factor in determining a suitable 
      landfill site for energy generation. In addition, the weight factors were used 
      for overlay analysis, in determining the suitable site for future energy 
      generation studies.

TI  - Risk-based decision making to manage contaminated sediments.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - This paper summarizes discussion among the 7 authors who served on an expert 
      panel at the Third Battelle International Conference on Remediation of 
      Contaminated Sediments held in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, in January 2005. In 
      this article, the authors review how sediment management decisions are currently 
      made and address the question of how management decisions should be made in the 
      future. It is arguably the case that sediment remediation presents greater 
      challenges and more complexity than traditional land-based clean-ups. Although 
      understanding of these challenges and complexities has grown over the last 25 y, 
      there has been, until recently, relatively little innovation in the approaches 
      used to manage the environmental risks posed by contaminated sediments. New 
      methods that facilitate a more rigorous analysis of the multiple criteria 
      considered in decision making have been developed. These methods, collectively 
      known as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), coupled with the use of 
      comparative-risk assessment and cost/benefit analysis, are proposed as an 
      effective, efficient, and credible foundation for evaluating remedy alternatives 
      at contaminated sediment sites.

TI  - Environmental management in North American mining sector.
PG  - 167-79
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-5651-8 [doi]
AB  - This paper reviews the environmental issues and management practices in the 
      mining sector in the North America. The sustainable measures on waste management 
      are recognized as one of the most serious environmental concerns in the mining 
      industry. For mining activities, it will be no surprise that the metal recovery 
      reagents and acid effluents are a threat to the ecosystem as well as hazards to 
      human health. In addition, poor air quality and ventilation in underground mines 
      can lead to occupational illness and death of workers. Electricity usage and fuel 
      consumption are major factors that contribute to greenhouse gases. On the other 
      hand, many sustainability challenges are faced in the management of tailings and 
      disposal of waste rock. This paper aims to highlight the problems that arise due 
      to poor air quality and acid mine drainage. The paper also addresses some of the 
      advantages and limitations of tailing and waste rock management that still have 
      to be studied in context of the mining sector. This paper suggests that 
      implementation of suitable environmental management tools like life cycle 
      assessment (LCA), cleaner production technologies (CPTs), and multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCD) are important as it ultimately lead to improve 
      environmental performance and enabling a mine to focus on the next stage of 
      sustainability.

TI  - Approaches to Aggregation and Decision Making-A Health Economics Approach: An 
      ISPOR Special Task Force Report [5].
PG  - 146-154
LID - S1098-3015(17)33895-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010 [doi]
AB  - The fifth section of our Special Task Force report identifies and discusses two 
      aggregation issues: 1) aggregation of cost and benefit information across 
      individuals to a population level for benefit plan decision making and 2) 
      combining multiple elements of value into a single value metric for individuals. 
      First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, 
      but such elements have not generally been included in measures of 
      quality-adjusted life-years. For example, we describe a recently developed 
      extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how 
      to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features-measures of financial 
      risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further 
      option for expanding this approach-augmented CEA, which can introduce many value 
      measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure 
      of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria 
      decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then 
      discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, 
      issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which 
      represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used 
      by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information 
      on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative 
      voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods 
      for developing "hedonic" value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations 
      in this area.

TI  - AHP and GIS for assessment of groundwater suitability for irrigation purpose in 
      coastal-arid zone: Gabes region, southeastern Tunisia.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-23193-4 [doi]
AB  - In southern Tunisia especially in Gabes region, irrigated agriculture is the 
      major economic sector. The intensive exploitation of groundwater have been 
      gradually rising, leading the water quality to deteriorate. To ensure sustainable 
      development and preserve water, soil, and land cover resources, a careful 
      estimation of the irrigation water quality, which influence on the regional 
      agriculture activities. The objective of this study is to investigate the 
      irrigation water suitability based on hydrogeological, hydrochemical, and 
      analytic hierarchy approach (AHP) and water quality index (WQI). Results 
      highlighted that TDS of the groundwater ranged from 0.4 to 6 g/L. The most 
      abundant chemical species in the water were Ca(2+), Cl(-), SO(4)(2-), and Na(+), 
      with mean concentration of 460 mg/L, 1320 mg/L, 1450 mg/L, and 1200 mg/L, 
      respectively. The largest amounts were discovered along the shoreline and in deep 
      aquifers embedded in Cretaceous sediments. AHP has used as multicriteria decision 
      analysis, to weighting groundwater quality criteria, and groundwater suitability 
      for irrigation has been mapped. Based on the Quality index "WQI", the water 
      samples are categorized into three types: excellent, acceptable, and worthless. A 
      45% of sampled water is not suitable for irrigation use. However, groundwater 
      quality is increasingly poor towards the coastal areas and north of the study 
      area. This study concluded that the method adopted in assessing the groundwater 
      quality in arid coastal areas led to important results and could be helpful 
      scholar to improve their research especially in similar areas. It can also assist 
      decision makers in taking proactive solutions to protect and preserve groundwater 
      resources from pollution risks.

AB  - The volume and variety of manufactured chemicals is increasing, although little 
      is known about the risks associated with the frequency and extent of human 
      exposure to most chemicals. The EPA and the recent signing of the Lautenberg Act 
      have both signaled the need for high-throughput methods to characterize and 
      screen chemicals based on exposure potential, such that more comprehensive 
      toxicity research can be informed. Prior work of Mitchell et al. using 
      multicriteria decision analysis tools to prioritize chemicals for further 
      research is enhanced here, resulting in a high-level chemical prioritization tool 
      for risk-based screening. Reliable exposure information is a key gap in currently 
      available engineering analytics to support predictive environmental and health 
      risk assessments. An elicitation with 32 experts informed relative prioritization 
      of risks from chemical properties and human use factors, and the values for each 
      chemical associated with each metric were approximated with data from EPA's 
      CP_CAT database. Three different versions of the model were evaluated using 
      distinct weight profiles, resulting in three different ranked chemical 
      prioritizations with only a small degree of variation across weight profiles. 
      Future work will aim to include greater input from human factors experts and 
      better define qualitative metrics.

TI  - Decision-Making Analytics Using Plural Resilience Parameters for Adaptive 
      Management of Complex Systems.
PG  - 871-889
LID - 10.1111/risa.13209 [doi]
AB  - It is critical for complex systems to effectively recover, adapt, and reorganize 
      after system disruptions. Common approaches for evaluating system resilience 
      typically study single measures of performance at one time, such as with a single 
      resilience curve. However, multiple measures of performance are needed for 
      complex systems that involve many components, functions, and noncommensurate 
      valuations of performance. Hence, this article presents a framework for: (1) 
      modeling resilience for complex systems with competing measures of performance, 
      and (2) modeling decision making for investing in these systems using multiple 
      stakeholder perspectives and multicriteria decision analysis. This resilience 
      framework, which is described and demonstrated in this article via a real-world 
      case study, will be of interest to managers of complex systems, such as supply 
      chains and large-scale infrastructure networks.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the prioritisation of healthcare projects where there is 
      a concern about health inequalities, but the decision maker is reluctant to make 
      explicit quantitative value judgements and the data systems only allow the 
      measurement of health at an aggregate level. Our analysis begins with a standard 
      welfare economic model of healthcare resource allocation. We show how - under the 
      assumption that the healthcare projects under consideration have a small impact 
      on individual health--the problem can be reformulated as one of finding a 
      particular subset of the class of efficient solutions to an implied multicriteria 
      optimisation problem. Algorithms for finding such solutions are readily 
      available, and we demonstrate our approach through a worked example of treatment 
      for clinical depression.

TI  - A case study using the PrOACT-URL and BRAT frameworks for structured benefit risk 
      assessment.
PG  - 8-27
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201300248 [doi]
AB  - While benefit-risk assessment is a key component of the drug development and 
      maintenance process, it is often described in a narrative. In contrast, 
      structured benefit-risk assessment builds on established ideas from decision 
      analysis and comprises a qualitative framework and quantitative methodology. We 
      compare two such frameworks, applying multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) 
      within the PrOACT-URL framework and weighted net clinical benefit (wNCB), within 
      the BRAT framework. These are applied to a case study of natalizumab for the 
      treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. We focus on the practical 
      considerations of applying these methods and give recommendations for visual 
      presentation of results. In the case study, we found structured benefit-risk 
      analysis to be a useful tool for structuring, quantifying, and communicating the 
      relative benefit and safety profiles of drugs in a transparent, rational and 
      consistent way. The two frameworks were similar. MCDA is a generic and flexible 
      methodology that can be used to perform a structured benefit-risk in any common 
      context. wNCB is a special case of MCDA and is shown to be equivalent to an 
      extension of the number needed to treat (NNT) principle. It is simpler to apply 
      and understand than MCDA and can be applied when all outcomes are measured on a 
      binary scale.

AB  - Contaminated sediment may pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems. 
      However, sediment remediation is typically an expensive and time-consuming 
      process. Therefore, an effective decision-making process for the remediation of 
      contaminated sediment is essential for identifying the optimal approach. Since a 
      single assessment for sediment remediation may be insufficient, combining 
      different analytical approaches is highly recommended. The objective of this 
      study was to develop a comprehensive assessment framework based on the concept of 
      green and sustainable remediation that considers various environmental, economic, 
      and social aspects for the management of contaminated sediment. We propose a 
      framework based on human health risk assessment (HHRA) and cost-benefit analysis 
      (CBA) and apply the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to implement 
      integrated and sustainable strategies for sediment management. We used the 
      framework to determine the best alternative for managing heavy-metal-contaminated 
      sediment in a river in Northern Taiwan. The results of the pre-remediation HHRA 
      indicated an unacceptably high cancer risk to children, while the CBA revealed 
      that a remediation project was economically feasible. Moreover, the results of 
      the MCDA revealed that a strategy involving in-situ capping with anthracite-based 
      activated carbon would be relatively inexpensive and result in low risk to human 
      health. In addition, this strategy would have a higher environmental impact and 
      greater public acceptance as compared to a method involving the dredging and 
      washing of soil. Thus, in this case study, in-situ capping using anthracite-based 
      activated carbon was identified as the preferable remediation alternative from 
      multiple perspectives. The proposed framework should allow decision-makers to 
      choose the optimal integrated management strategy for similar river sites with 
      contaminated sediment.

LID - 10.1177/2168479014536500 [doi]
AB  - Assessing the utility of structured approaches to benefit-risk assessment of 
      medicinal products is challenging, in part due to the lack of a gold standard for 
      results and the uncertainty inherent in the data. In place of conducting formal 
      testing, obtaining feedback from users of structured approaches provides insight 
      into their value and limitations. The authors conducted a simulated 
      single-session benefit-risk decision in which 3 groups applied the PhRMA 
      BRAT(Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America Benefit-Risk Action 
      Team) framework or the multicriteria decision analysis approach. The groups were 
      provided with background and data for a hypothetical triptan for acute migraine 
      in a population with cardiovascular risk factors and were asked to determine and 
      defend an approval decision. Three insights emerged consistently from the groups: 
      (1) the value of a structured approach to benefit-risk assessment, (2) the 
      clarity provided by real-time visualization tools, and, most critically, (3) the 
      importance of bringing the patient into the discussion early.

AB  - A growing number of health care systems internationally use formal economic 
      evaluation methods to support health care funding decisions. Recently, a range of 
      organizations have been advocating forms of analysis that have been termed "value 
      frameworks." There has also been a push for analytical methods to reflect a 
      fuller range of benefits of interventions through multicriteria decision 
      analysis. A key principle that is invariably neglected in current and proposed 
      frameworks is the need to reflect evidence on the opportunity costs that health 
      systems face when making funding decisions. The mechanisms by which opportunity 
      costs are realized vary depending on the system's financial arrangements, but 
      they always mean that a decision to fund a specific intervention for a particular 
      patient group has the potential to impose costs on others in terms of forgone 
      benefits. These opportunity costs are rarely explicitly reflected in analysis to 
      support decisions, but recent developments to quantify benefits forgone make more 
      appropriate analyses feasible. Opportunity costs also need to be reflected in 
      decisions if a broader range of attributes of benefit is considered, and 
      opportunity costs are a key consideration in determining the appropriate level of 
      total expenditure in a system. The principles by which opportunity costs can be 
      reflected in analysis are illustrated in this article by using the example of the 
      proposed methods for value-based pricing in the United Kingdom.

TI  - Application of HTA research on policy decision-making.
PG  - S119-26
AB  - This article provides an overview of the potential uses of health technology 
      assessment (HTA) in health technology or health intervention-related policy 
      decision-making. It summarises the role of HTA in policy planning, health system 
      investment, price negotiation, development of clinical practice guidelines, and 
      communication with health professionals. While the multifaceted nature of HTA 
      means that some aspects of the data can result in conflicting conclusions, the 
      comprehensive approach of HTA is still recommended. To help minimise the 
      potential conflicts within HTA data, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) 
      approach is recommended as a way to assess a number of decision criteria 
      simultaneously. A combination of HTA with MCDA allows policy decision-making to 
      be undertaken in an empirically rigorous and rational way. This combination can 
      be used to support policy decision-makers in Thailand and help them prioritise 
      topics for assessment and make informed health benefit package coverage 
      decisions. This approach enhances the legitimacy of policy decisions by 
      increasing the transparency, systematic nature, and inclusiveness of the process.

TI  - Assessment of ecological risks at former landfill site using TRIAD procedure and

PG  - 203-19

AB  - Old industrial landfills are important sources of environmental contamination in 
      Europe, including Finland. In this study, we demonstrated the combination of 
      TRIAD procedure, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and statistical Monte 
      Carlo analysis for assessing the risks to terrestrial biota in a former landfill 
      site contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and metals. First, we 
      generated hazard quotients by dividing the concentrations of metals and PHCs in 
      soil by the corresponding risk-based ecological benchmarks. Then we conducted 
      ecotoxicity tests using five plant species, earthworms, and potworms, and 
      determined the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates from additional 
      samples. We aggregated the results in accordance to the methods used in the TRIAD 
      procedure, conducted rating of the assessment methods based on their performance 
      in terms of specific criteria, and weighted the criteria using two alternative 
      weighting techniques to produce performance scores for each method. We faced 
      problems in using the TRIAD procedure, for example, the results from the animal 
      counts had to be excluded from the calculation of integrated risk estimates 
      (IREs) because our reference soil sample showed the lowest biodiversity and 
      abundance of soil animals. In addition, hormesis hampered the use of the results 
      from the ecotoxicity tests. The final probabilistic IREs imply significant risks 
      at all sampling locations. Although linking MCDA with TRIAD provided a useful 
      means to study and consider the performance of the alternative methods in 
      predicting ecological risks, some uncertainties involved still remained outside 
      the quantitative analysis.

TI  - Assessing Lung Cancer Screening Programs under Uncertainty in a Heterogeneous 
      Population.
PG  - 1269-1277
LID - S1098-3015(18)32244-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening can reduce cancer mortality. Most 
      implementation studies focus only on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and 
      clinical attributes of screening and do not include preferences of potential 
      participants. In this study we evaluated the perceived value of screening 
      programs based on LDCT, breath analysis (BA), or blood biomarkers (BB) according 
      to the perspective of the target population. METHODS: A multi-criteria decision 
      analysis framework was adopted. The weights of seven attributes of screening 
      (sensitivity, specificity, radiation burden, duration of screening process, 
      waiting time until results are communicated, location of screening, and mode of 
      screening) were obtained from an earlier study that included a broad sample from 
      the Netherlands. Performance data for the screening modalities was obtained from 
      clinical trials and expert opinion. Parameter uncertainty about clinical 
      performances was incorporated probabilistically, while heterogeneity in 
      preferences was analyzed through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: The mean overall 
      values were 0.58 (CI: 0.57 to 0.59), 0.57 (CI: 0.56 to 0.59), and 0.44 (CI: 0.43 
      to 0.45) for BB, BA, and LDCT, respectively. Seventy-seven per cent of 
      respondents preferred BB or BA. For most subgroups, the overall values were 
      similar to those of the entire sample. BA had the highest value for respondents 
      who would have been eligible for earlier screening trials. DISCUSSION: BB and BA 
      seem valuable to participants because they can be applied in a primary care 
      setting. Although LDCT still seems preferable given its strong and positive 
      evidence base, it is important to take non-clinical attributes into account to 
      maximize attendance.

TI  - A multiscale approach to balance trade-offs among dam infrastructure, river

PG  - 12069-12074
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1807437115 [doi]
AB  - Aging infrastructure and growing interests in river restoration have led to a 
      substantial rise in dam removals in the United States. However, the decision to 
      remove a dam involves many complex trade-offs. The benefits of dam removal for 
      hazard reduction and ecological restoration are potentially offset by the loss of 
      hydroelectricity production, water supply, and other important services. We use a 
      multiobjective approach to examine a wide array of trade-offs and synergies 
      involved with strategic dam removal at three spatial scales in New England. We 
      find that increasing the scale of decision-making improves the efficiency of 
      trade-offs among ecosystem services, river safety, and economic costs resulting 
      from dam removal, but this may lead to heterogeneous and less equitable 
      local-scale outcomes. Our model may help facilitate multilateral funding, policy, 
      and stakeholder agreements by analyzing the trade-offs of coordinated dam 
      decisions, including net benefit alternatives to dam removal, at scales that 
      satisfy these agreements.

TI  - MCRiceRepGP: a framework for the identification of genes associated with sexual 
      reproduction in rice.
PG  - 188-202
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14019 [doi]
AB  - Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the 
      world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation 
      underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, 
      many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, 
      involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an 
      increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from 
      different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We 
      report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which 
      integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and 
      machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual 
      reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing 
      transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying 
      previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP 
      was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and 
      lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct 
      expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum 
      expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to 
      male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the 
      reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide 
      studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that 
      the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As 
      more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power 
      of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate 
      genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application 
      (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/).

TI  - GIS- and MCD-based suitability assessment for optimized location of solid waste 
      landfills in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
PG  - 11259-11278
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-11213-0 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent advancements in waste management technologies, landfills remain 
      the dominant approach for the final disposal of solid waste (SW) around the 
      world. However, landfills are associated with adverse environmental and 
      health-related impacts. This study is primarily applied to Dar es Salaam, a city 
      in the East African region that has failed to follow appropriate approaches for 
      site selection and that the methods used to select the current sites are manually 
      operated. The study used a geographical information system (GIS) combined with 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to objectively determine the optimal 
      landfill sites. A comprehensive list of assessment criteria was examined through 
      a computerized site selection procedure based on GIS to analyze the ground that 
      was surveyed and to remotely obtain data. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-one 
      of the best MCDA approaches-was used to assign relative weight and evaluate each 
      criterion. Finally, the study computed site suitability indices (SSIs), which 
      aids in the identification of site suitability levels (SSLs) for the entire 
      region. The final suitability map produced by overlaying the criteria map layers 
      showed that a large part of the study area (60.92%) was completely unsuitable for 
      landfill siting. The remaining areas consisted of land with varying suitability 
      level, which were grouped into four classes: very low (30.92%), low (2.05%), 
      moderate (5.65%), and high (0.46). To this end, only the high suitability class 
      (0.46%) was of acceptable suitability levels (ASLs) (SSI ≥ 2.0). From the 
      numerous identified sites with ASL, only three sites were suggested. Due to 
      concerns regarding the lifespan and environment-related risks associated with 
      these suggested sites, there is a need to further study new environmentally 
      friendly techniques, considering the importance of circular economy agenda of 
      waste to resource/energy for sustainable solid waste management.

TI  - Moving Towards Accountability for Reasonableness - A Systematic Exploration of 
      the Features of Legitimate Healthcare Coverage Decision-Making Processes Using 
      Rare Diseases and Regenerative Therapies as a Case Study.
PG  - 424-443
LID - 10.15171/ijhpm.2019.24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accountability for reasonableness (A4R) framework defines 4 
      conditions for legitimate healthcare coverage decision processes: Relevance, 
      Publicity, Appeals, and Enforcement. The aim of this study was to reflect on how 
      the diverse features of decision-making processes can be aligned with A4R 
      conditions to guide decision-making towards legitimacy. Rare disease and 
      regenerative therapies (RDRTs) pose special decision-making challenges and offer 
      therefore a useful case study. METHODS: Features operationalizing each A4R 
      condition as well as three different approaches to address these features 
      (cost-per-QALY-focused and multicriteria-based) were defined and organized into a 
      matrix. Seven experts explored these features during a panel run under the 
      Chatham House Rule and provided general and RDRT-specific recommendations. 
      Responses were analyzed to identify converging and diverging recommendations. 
      RESULTS: Regarding Relevance, recommendations included supporting deliberation, 
      stakeholder participation and grounding coverage decision criteria in normative 
      and societal objectives. Thirteen of 17 proposed decision criteria were 
      recommended by a majority of panelists. The usefulness of universal 
      cost-effectiveness thresholds to inform allocative efficiency was challenged, 
      particularly in the RDRT context. RDRTs raise specific issues that need to be 
      considered; however, rarity should be viewed in relation to other aspects, such 
      as disease severity and budget impact. Regarding Publicity, panelists recommended 
      transparency about the values underlying a decision and value judgements used in 
      selecting evidence. For Appeals, recommendations included a life-cycle approach 
      with clear provisions for re-evaluations. For Enforcement, external quality 
      reviews of decisions were recommended. CONCLUSION: Moving coverage 
      decision-making processes towards enhanced legitimacy in general and in the RDRT 
      context involves designing and refining approaches to support participation and 
      deliberation, enhancing transparency, and allowing explicit consideration of 
      multiple decision criteria that reflect normative and societal objectives.

TI  - Equivalence analysis to support environmental safety assessment: Using nontarget 
      organism count data from field trials with cisgenically modified potato.
PG  - 2863-2882
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4964 [doi]
AB  - This paper considers the statistical analysis of entomological count data from 
      field experiments with genetically modified (GM) plants. Such trials are carried 
      out to assess environmental safety. Potential effects on nontarget organisms 
      (NTOs), as indicators of biodiversity, are investigated. The European Food Safety 
      Authority (EFSA) gives broad guidance on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
      of GM plants. Field experiments must contain suitable comparator crops as a 
      benchmark for the assessment of designated endpoints. In this paper, a detailed 
      protocol is proposed to perform data analysis for the purpose of assessing 
      environmental safety. The protocol includes the specification of a list of 
      endpoints and their hierarchical relations, the specification of intended levels 
      of data analysis, and the specification of provisional limits of concern to 
      decide on the need for further investigation. The protocol emphasizes a graphical 
      representation of estimates and confidence intervals for the ratio of mean 
      abundances for the GM plant and its comparator crop. Interpretation relies mainly 
      on equivalence testing in which confidence intervals are compared with the limits 
      of concern. The proposed methodology is illustrated with entomological count data 
      resulting from multiyear, multilocation field trials. A cisgenically modified 
      potato line (with enhanced resistance to late blight disease) was compared to the 
      original conventional potato variety in the Netherlands and Ireland in two 
      successive years (2013, 2014). It is shown that the protocol encompasses 
      alternative schemes for safety assessment resulting from different research 
      questions and/or expert choices. Graphical displays of equivalence testing at 
      several hierarchical levels and their interpretation are presented for one of 
      these schemes. The proposed approaches should be of help in the ERA of GM or 
      other novel plants.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources instead of conventional energy sources is at 
      the core of policy actions to reduce dependency on fossil fuels worldwide. As a 
      result, especially during the last decade, the cost of renewable energy has 
      significantly decreased, enriching renewable energy cost-competitiveness. Due to 
      the spatial nature of renewable energy sector-related decisions, the synergy of 
      geographical information systems (GIS) and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis 
      (MCDA) models can enrich the quality of the related decisions given their ability 
      to effectively support land management considerations. Moreover, their 
      implementation significantly enriches the performance of the traditional capital 
      projects evaluation methods (CPEM) by providing physical data to the sizing 
      process in a quick and accurate manner. Thus, decision-making frameworks that 
      combine GIS-based suitability analysis with traditional financial evaluation 
      techniques can significantly enrich the planning phase to achieve efficient 
      installations in terms of required area reduction, power generation maximization 
      and local characteristics examination. With respect to the realization of wind 
      energy exploitation projects, the paper at hand proposes a framework capable of 
      expanding the use of the traditional GIS-based derived suitability index to 
      establishing portfolios. Moreover, the proposed framework is enriched by robust 
      analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), which provides significant insights 
      regarding the stability of the derived portfolios and the projects that they 
      comprise. The proposed framework is illustrated through a case study in the 
      Thrace region in northeastern Greece.

AB  - The economic evaluation of new health technologies to assess whether the value of 
      the expected health benefits warrants the proposed additional costs has become an 
      essential step in making novel interventions available to patients. This 
      assessment of value is problematic because there exists no natural means to 
      measure it. One approach is to assume that society wishes to maximize aggregate 
      health, measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Commonly, a 
      single 'cost-effectiveness' threshold is used to gauge whether the intervention 
      is sufficiently efficient in doing so. This approach has come under fire for 
      failing to account for societal values that favor treating more severe illness 
      and ensuring equal access to resources, regardless of pre-existing conditions or 
      capacity to benefit. Alternatives involving expansion of the measure of benefit 
      or adjusting the threshold have been proposed and some have advocated tacking 
      away from the cost per QALY entirely to implement therapeutic area-specific 
      efficiency frontiers, multicriteria decision analysis or other approaches that 
      keep the dimensions of benefit distinct and value them separately. In this paper, 
      each of these alternative courses is considered, based on the experiences of the 
      authors, with a view to clarifying their implications.

AB  - Today resilience paradigm is shared by both academic and political debates, and 
      it is gradually being implemented into plans, programmes, and project's 
      initiatives. In this context, wine regions, particularly those designated as 
      UNESCO sites, show their robustness and vulnerabilities as Socio-Ecological 
      Systems. The climate change impact is increasing the exposure of their aesthetic, 
      cultural, economic, natural values to potential losses and therefore an effective 
      response is required To build resilient strategies, Decision Makers are 
      increasingly considering multidimensional models in planning and assessment 
      processes. This paper continues a research work that develops an integrated 
      evaluation framework constituted by Multicriteria Decision Analysis to calculate 
      a Territorial Resilience Index, a dynamical model to predict future ecological 
      scenarios and scenario building to define a resilient strategy for the Douro 
      territory (Portugal). This paper focuses on scenario building which uses specific 
      tools such as Social Network Analysis to identify and investigate the 
      relationships between real actors and stakeholders, Wilson matrix to assess the 
      degree of uncertainty and relevance of the strategies identified by a panel of 
      specialists, and consistency matrix to evaluate the strategies consistency in 
      achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and UNESCO requirements. The obtained 
      protocol of guidelines and recommendations can support Decision Makers in the 
      design of sustainable and resilient transformation, thereby assisting in the 
      preservation of the UNESCO site.

TI  - The changing role of economic evaluation in valuing medical technologies.
PG  - 711-23
LID - 10.1586/erp.12.73 [doi]
AB  - Economic evaluation is established within health-technology assessment but is 
      challenged by those wanting to use economic evaluation to inform pricing and/or 
      incorporate nontraditional sources of value and the views of diverse 
      stakeholders. The changing role of economic evaluation in (formally or 
      informally) assessing prices/values in four jurisdictions (UK, Australia, Germany 
      and USA) is detailed and the authors propose a taxonomy of factors impacting the 
      value of medical technology spanning clinical utility (effectiveness, 
      safety/tolerability and quality of evidence), consumer demand (consumer 
      preferences, process utility and unmet need), economic incentives (innovation, 
      option value and market competition) and the societal perspective (social 
      justice, social values and national interest). The authors suggest that 
      multicriteria decision analysis methods grounded in hedonic-pricing theory can 
      facilitate the valuing/pricing of medical technologies. The use of such an 
      approach is hindered by a paucity of relevant educational opportunities, vested 
      interests and aversion to placing prices/values on health.

TI  - Public Health Interventions with Harms and Benefits: A Graphical Framework for 
      Evaluating Tradeoffs.
PG  - 978-989
LID - 10.1177/0272989X20960458 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluations of public health interventions typically report benefits 
      and harms aggregated over the population. However, benefits and harms are not 
      always evenly distributed. Examining disaggregated outcomes enables decision 
      makers to consider health benefits and harms accruing to both intended 
      intervention recipients and others in the population. METHODS: We provide a 
      graphical framework for categorizing and comparing public health interventions 
      that examines the distribution of benefit and harm between and within population 
      subgroups for a single intervention and compares distributions of harm and 
      benefit for multiple interventions. We demonstrate the framework through a case 
      study of a hypothetical increase in the price of meat (5%, 10%, 25%, or 50%) 
      that, via elasticity of demand, reduces consumption and consequently reduces body 
      mass index. We examine how inequalities in benefits and harms (measured by 
      quality-adjusted life-years) are distributed across a population of white and 
      black males and females. RESULTS: A 50% meat price increase would yield the 
      greatest net benefit to the population. However, because of reduced consumption 
      among low-weight individuals, black males would bear disproportionate harm 
      relative to the benefit they receive. With increasing meat price, the 
      distribution of harm relative to benefit becomes less "internal" to those 
      receiving benefit and more "distributed" to those not receiving commensurate 
      benefit. When we segment the population by sex only, this result does not hold. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Disaggregating harms and benefits to understand their differential 
      impact on subgroups can strongly affect which decision alternative is deemed 
      optimal, as can the approach to segmenting the population. Our framework provides 
      a useful tool for illuminating key tradeoffs relevant to harm-averse decision 
      makers and those concerned with both equity and efficiency.

AB  - Exploring methods that value diverse perspectives is critical to better 
      understand the value of health equity in value assessment frameworks. In this 
      paper, we examined emerging value assessment frameworks in the United States and 
      present examples where evidence on outcomes and preferences for value do not take 
      into consideration diverse perspectives. We identify possible solutions to 
      improve existing value assessment methods and illustrate-using a hypothetical 
      shared decision-making case study-an alternative to current value-assessment 
      frameworks, "equitable multicriteria decision analysis," which could be 
      implemented in the context of the value-based assessment of prevention choices 
      for women at high risk of developing breast cancer. These proposed alternatives 
      and solutions can be used by researchers and decision makers to incorporate 
      health equity into value assessment. DISCLOSURES: No funding was received for

TI  - An anticipatory governance approach to carbon nanotubes.
PG  - 1708-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01445.x [doi]
AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are novel materials with remarkable properties; possible 
      beneficial applications include aircraft frames, hydrogen storage, environmental 
      sensors, electrical transmission, and many more. At the same time, precise 
      characterization of their potential toxicity remains elusive, in part because 
      engineered nanostructures pose challenges to existing assays, predictive models, 
      and dosimetry. While these obstacles are surmountable, their presence suggests 
      that scientific uncertainty regarding the hazards of CNTs is likely to persist. 
      Traditional U.S. policy approaches implicitly pose the question: "What level of 
      evidence is necessary and sufficient to justify regulatory action?" In the case 
      of CNTs, such a strategy of risk analysis is of limited immediate utility to both 
      regulators essaying to carry out their mandates, and users of CNTs seeking to 
      provide an appropriate level of protection to employees, customers, and other 
      stakeholders. In contrast, the concept of anticipatory governance suggests an 
      alternative research focus, that is: "Given the conflicted character of the data, 
      how should relevant actors respond?" Adopting the latter theoretical framework, 
      this article argues that currently available data support treating CNTs "as if" 
      they are hazardous, while simultaneously highlighting some systemic uncertainties 
      in many of the experiments carried out to date. Such a conclusion implies 
      limiting exposure throughout product lifecycles, and also points to the possible 
      applicability of various conceptual tools, such as life-cycle and multicriteria 
      decision analysis approaches, in choosing appropriate courses of action in the 
      face of prolonged uncertainty.

LID - 10.1637/0005-2086-63.sp1.257 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the study was to identify the areas at increased risk of highly 
      pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurrence in commercial poultry in Poland. To 
      identify the risk factors related to the occurrence of HPAI outbreaks, the 
      opinions of Polish experts were combined with literature-driven knowledge. The 
      relative impact of each risk factor was determined using a multicriteria decision 
      analysis approach. The applied model suggests that the greatest risk of HPAI 
      occurrence is concentrated in several counties in the eastern, western, and 
      central parts of the country. The most influential risk actors responsible for 
      HPAI occurrence in Poland included waterfowl density and proximity to 
      waterbodies. The model had a high predictive value (area under the curve = 0.78). 
      The developed spatial risk assessment of HPAI occurrence provides a valuable 
      source of information for risk managers and can contribute to early detection of 
      potential outbreaks of HPAI in poultry.

TI  - Combining Health and Outcomes Beyond Health in Complex Evaluations of Complex 
      Interventions: Suggestions for Economic Evaluation.
PG  - 511-517
LID - S1098-3015(19)30036-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2019.01.002 [doi]
AB  - In this journal there has been considerable discussion regarding the development 
      of tools for valuing the multiple attributes that arise from complex 
      interventions with benefits beyond health. Nevertheless, unlike the rigorous 
      underpinnings of cost-utility analysis, much of this work has been taking place 
      in fragmented research communities and without theoretical underpinnings, leading 
      to a call for better and more comprehensive frameworks. We discuss the challenges 
      faced by economic evaluation using as our example a "social prescribing" 
      intervention, a novel health intervention based on the social model of health. We 
      suggest a mixed-methods approach to uncover important attributes and then combine 
      tools from health economics and economics to provide measures of benefit in a 
      common money numeraire. This approach provides the theoretical underpinnings 
      necessary for deliberate, transparent, and structured decision-making processes. 
      It also enables the correct allocation of costs within complex payment systems. 
      We suggest that, because of the complexities of randomized controlled trials, 
      interventions should be introduced in a way that allows the application of causal 
      analysis for evaluation. In the short term, such evaluations may be challenging 
      and expensive. Nevertheless, as has happened with health economics evaluation and 
      the quality-adjusted life-year, when a common set of attributes is agreed upon, 
      the expense will fall and these methods can become embedded in interventions with 
      diffuse outcomes.

TI  - Multi-Stakeholder Decision Aid for Improved Prioritization of the Public Health 
      Impact of Climate Sensitive Infectious Diseases.
PG  - 419
LID - 10.3390/ijerph13040419 [doi]
LID - 419
AB  - The effects of climate change on infectious diseases are an important global 
      health concern and necessitate decisions for allocation of resources. Economic 
      tools have been used previously; however, how prioritization results might differ 
      when done using broader considerations identified by local stakeholders has yet 
      to be assessed. A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used to 
      assess multi-stakeholder expressed concerns around disease prioritization via 
      focus groups held in Quebec and Burkina Faso. Stakeholders weighted criteria and 
      comparisons were made across study sites. A pilot disease prioritization was done 
      to examine effects on disease rankings. A majority of identified criteria were 
      common to both sites. The effect of context specific criteria and weights 
      resulted in similar yet distinct prioritizations of diseases. The presence of 
      consistent criteria between sites suggests that common concerns exist for 
      prioritization; however, context-specific adjustments reveal much regarding 
      resource availability, capacity and concerns that should be considered as this 
      impacts disease ranking. Participatory decision aid approaches facilitate rich 
      knowledge exchange and problem structuring. Furthermore, given multiple actors in 
      low- and middle-income countries settings, multi-actor collaborations across 
      non-governmental organizations, local government and community are important. 
      Formal mechanisms such as MCDA provide means to foster consensus, shared 
      awareness and collaboration.

TI  - A European care bundle for management of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
PG  - 3-10
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.04.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is a wealth of guidance concerning the management of 
      patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), compliance with 
      recommendations concerning optimal treatment practices is highly variable. 
      METHODS: This document presents a comprehensive care bundle package addressing 
      all aspects of VAP diagnosis and treatment in an attempt to promote 
      guideline-compliant practices. Uniquely, the development of these care bundles 
      used a formalized method to assess the supporting data, based on multicriteria 
      decision analysis. RESULTS: This system allowed the numerous VAP management 
      parameters identified from recent European guidelines to be ranked according to 
      defined criteria. The resulting VAP care bundles are (a) diagnosis: early chest 
      x-rays within 1 hour, immediate reporting of respiratory secretions Gram 
      staining, and (b) therapy: immediate treatment, empiric therapy based on local 
      pathogens and risk factors, de-escalation, assessment of response within 72 
      hours, and short therapy duration if feasible. CONCLUSION: Adoption of these care 
      bundles should rationalize VAP management practices and facilitate the 
      development of consistent and guideline-compliant care processes.

      Evidence-Informed Deliberative Processes.

AB  - Priority setting in health care has been long recognized as an intrinsically 
      complex and value-laden process. Yet, health technology assessment agencies 
      (HTAs) presently employ value assessment frameworks that are ill fitted to 
      capture the range and diversity of stakeholder values and thereby risk 
      compromising the legitimacy of their recommendations. We propose 
      "evidence-informed deliberative processes" as an alternative framework with the 
      aim to enhance this legitimacy. This framework integrates two increasingly 
      popular and complementary frameworks for priority setting: multicriteria decision 
      analysis and accountability for reasonableness. Evidence-informed deliberative 
      processes are, on one hand, based on early, continued stakeholder deliberation to 
      learn about the importance of relevant social values. On the other hand, they are 
      based on rational decision-making through evidence-informed evaluation of the 
      identified values. The framework has important implications for how HTA agencies 
      should ideally organize their processes. First, HTA agencies should take the 
      responsibility of organizing stakeholder involvement. Second, agencies are 
      advised to integrate their assessment and appraisal phases, allowing for the 
      timely collection of evidence on values that are considered relevant. Third, HTA 
      agencies should subject their decision-making criteria to public scrutiny. 
      Fourth, agencies are advised to use a checklist of potentially relevant criteria 
      and to provide argumentation for how each criterion affected the recommendation. 
      Fifth, HTA agencies must publish their argumentation and install options for 
      appeal. The framework should not be considered a blueprint for HTA agencies but 
      rather an aspirational goal-agencies can take incremental steps toward achieving 
      this goal.

TI  - Stakeholder Perspectives on Barriers and Facilitators for the Adoption of Virtual 
      Clinical Trials: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e26813
LID - 10.2196/26813 [doi]
LID - e26813
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional clinical trials are essential for generating 
      high-quality evidence by measuring the efficacy of interventions in rigorously 
      controlled clinical environments. However, their execution can be expensive and 
      time-consuming. In addition, clinical trials face several logistical challenges 
      regarding the identification, recruitment, and retention of participants; 
      consistent data collection during trials; and adequate patient follow-up. This 
      might lead to inefficient resource utilization. In order to partially address the 
      current problems with conventional clinical trials, there exists the need for 
      innovations. One such innovation is the virtual clinical trial (VCT). VCTs allow 
      for the collection and integration of diverse data from multiple information 
      sources, such as electronic health records, clinical and demographic data, 
      patient-reported outcomes, anthropometric and activity measurements, and data 
      collected by digital biomarkers or (small) samples that participants can collect 
      themselves. Although VCTs have the potential to provide substantial value to 
      clinical research and patients because they can lower clinical trial costs, 
      increase the volume of data collected from patients' daily environment, and 
      reduce the burden of patient participation, so far VCT adoption is not 
      commonplace. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to better understand the barriers and 
      facilitators to VCT adoption by determining the factors that influence 
      individuals' considerations regarding VCTs from the perspective of various 
      stakeholders. METHODS: Based on online semistructured interviews, a qualitative 
      study was conducted with pharmaceutical companies, food and health organizations, 
      and an applied research organization in Europe. Data were thematically analyzed 
      using Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory. RESULTS: A total of 16 individuals 
      with interest and experience in VCTs were interviewed, including persons from 
      pharmaceutical companies (n=6), food and health organizations (n=4), and a 
      research organization (n=6). Key barriers included a potentially low degree of 
      acceptance by regulatory authorities, technical issues (standardization, 
      validation, and data storage), compliance and adherence, and lack of knowledge or 
      comprehension regarding the opportunities VCTs have to offer. Involvement of 
      regulators in development processes, stakeholder exposure to the results of pilot 
      studies, and clear and simple instructions and assistance for patients were 
      considered key facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration among all stakeholders in 
      VCT development is crucial to increase knowledge and awareness. Organizations 
      should invest in accurate data collection technologies, and compliance of 
      patients in VCTs needs to be ensured. Multicriteria decision analysis can help 
      determine if a VCT is a preferred option by stakeholders. The findings of this 
      study can be a good starting point to accelerate the development and widespread 
      implementation of VCTs.

AB  - CONTEXT: Treating vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains requires 
      high doses of vancomycin, which might lead to adverse reactions such as 
      nephrotoxicity and "red neck syndrome". Use of nanotechnology for antibiotic 
      delivery is a promising approach to overcome antibiotic-resistance. OBJECTIVE: 
      The objective of this study was optimizing the particle size and encapsulation 
      efficiency (EE) of vancomycin nanoparticles prepared from chitosan. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The nanoparticles were prepared by ionotropic gelation method, at 
      different combinations of chitosan concentration, chitosan/tripolyphosphate mass 
      and vancomycin/chitosan mass, using Box-Behnken experimental design. Dynamic 
      light scattering and ultracentrifugation were used to measure the nanoparticle 
      size and EE, respectively. Vancomycin was quantified in samples by 
      spectrophotometery. The optimum conditions were determined by subsequent 
      regression analysis and multicriteria decision analysis of the output data. 
      RESULTS: The nanoparticle size and EE were greatly influenced by the independent 
      variables, which had interactive effects on both responses. The optimum 
      conditions for production of nanoparticles were chitosan concentration of 
      0.5-1.2 mg/ml, chitosan/tripolyphosphate mass ratio of 3-3.5 and 
      vancomycin/chitosan mass ratio of 1, which yielded nanoparticles between 130 and 
      150 nm with encapsulation efficiencies of 60-69%. CONCLUSIONS: The size and EE of 
      vancomycin nanoparticles were optimized by the proposed procedure.

TI  - Prioritization of sediment management alternatives using stochastic multicriteria 
      acceptability analysis.
PG  - 4354-67
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.07.016 [doi]
AB  - Decision-making for sediment management is a complex task that requires the 
      consideration of temporal and spatial impacts of several remedial alternatives as 
      well as the associated economic, social and political impact. Multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important 
      environmental management tool that can be used to support the selection of 
      suitable remediation alternatives and prioritization of management units in space 
      and time. This paper proposes an MCDA framework for prioritizing sediment 
      management alternatives. This framework involves identifying of a set of feasible 
      options, as well as defining and evaluating criteria which integrate relevant 
      technical, economic, social and environmental aspects of remedies. The 
      methodology allows an explicit consideration of uncertainty in criteria scores 
      and weights by assigning probability distributions and analyzing subsequent 
      Monte-Carlo simulations. The consideration of different stakeholder simulated 
      values is used to assess the robustness of alternative rankings and to guide the 
      selection of remediation options. An application of this methodology to a case 
      study in the Bay of Santander, Spain, is presented. An assessment is conducted 
      for the case of unknown preferences as well as for hypothetical preferences 
      profiles for four types of stakeholders: Idealist, Politician, Environmentalist 
      and Balanced. The results are used to visualize stakeholder positions and 
      potential disagreements, allowing for the identification of a group of least 
      preferred alternatives for each stakeholder. Stakeholder involvement has the 
      potential to ease the remedy selection process during all stages of the 
      decision-making process and to eventually remedy implementation.

TI  - A Health Economics Approach to US Value Assessment Frameworks-Summary and 
      Recommendations of the ISPOR Special Task Force Report [7].
PG  - 161-165
LID - S1098-3015(17)33894-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.009 [doi]
AB  - This summary section first lists key points from each of the six sections of the 
      report, followed by six key recommendations. The Special Task Force chose to take 
      a health economics approach to the question of whether a health plan should cover 
      and reimburse a specific technology, beginning with the view that the 
      conventional cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year metric has both strengths as a 
      starting point and recognized limitations. This report calls for the development 
      of a more comprehensive economic evaluation that could include novel elements of 
      value (e.g., insurance value and equity) as part of either an "augmented" 
      cost-effectiveness analysis or a multicriteria decision analysis. Given an 
      aggregation of elements to a measure of value, consistent use of a 
      cost-effectiveness threshold can help ensure the maximization of health gain and 
      well-being for a given budget. These decisions can benefit from the use of 
      deliberative processes. The six recommendations are to: 1) be explicit about 
      decision context and perspective in value assessment frameworks; 2) base health 
      plan coverage and reimbursement decisions on an evaluation of the incremental 
      costs and benefits of health care technologies as is provided by 
      cost-effectiveness analysis; 3) develop value thresholds to serve as one 
      important input to help guide coverage and reimbursement decisions; 4) manage 
      budget constraints and affordability on the basis of cost-effectiveness 
      principles; 5) test and consider using structured deliberative processes for 
      health plan coverage and reimbursement decisions; and 6) explore and test novel 
      elements of benefit to improve value measures that reflect the perspectives of 
      both plan members and patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the benefit-risk (BR) balance of the quadrivalent human 
      papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine for use in males, including anal cancer prevention, 
      by using the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). METHODS: Value tree and an 
      effect table were compiled using relevant qHPV vaccine efficacy/safety data. An 
      expert panel validated the final model inputs. RESULTS: On a scale of 0-100, the 
      MCDA qHPV vaccine score (66) was superior to the no vaccination score (46), 
      indicating a more favorable BR balance for the qHPV vaccine. Significant changes 
      in weight of individual outcomes were needed to change BR balance in sensitivity 
      analyses. The qHPV vaccine maintained a better BR profile in all alternative 
      models. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA can be used to transparently evaluate BR balance of 
      vaccines. The qHPV vaccine had a favorable BR balance in males. Including anal 
      cancer as a new indication further improves the BR profile of the qHPV vaccine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of tools to quantify the response to monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs) holistically in severe uncontrolled asthma patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To develop a valid score to assist specialists in this clinical context. METHODS: 
      The score was developed in four subsequent phases: (1) elaboration of the 
      theoretical model of the construct intended to be measured (response to mAbs); 
      (2) definition and selection of items and measurement instruments by Delphi 
      survey; (3) weight assignment of the selected items by multicriteria decision 
      analysis using the Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of All Possible Alternatives 
      methodology using the 1000minds software; and (4) face validity assessment of the 
      obtained score. RESULTS: Four core items, with different levels of response for 
      each, were selected: severe exacerbations, oral corticosteroid use, symptoms 
      (evaluated by Asthma Control Test), and bronchial obstruction (assessed by FEV(1) 
      percent predicted). Severe exacerbations and oral corticosteroid maintenance dose 
      were weighted most heavily (38% each), followed by symptoms (13%) and FEV(1) 
      (11%). Higher scores in the weighted system indicate a better response and the 
      range of responses runs from 0 (worsening) to 100 (best possible response). Face 
      validity was high (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      FEV(1), exacerbations, oral corticosteroids, symptoms score allows clinicians to 
      quantify response in severe uncontrolled asthma patients who are being treated

TI  - A proposed approach for quantitative benefit-risk assessment in diagnostic 
      radiology guideline development: the American College of Radiology 
      Appropriateness Criteria Example.
PG  - 128-138
LID - 10.1111/jep.12635 [doi]
AB  - The American College of Radiology develops evidence-based practice guidelines to 
      aid appropriate utilization of radiological procedures. Panel members use expert 
      opinion to weight trade-offs and consensus methods to rate appropriateness of 
      imaging tests. These ratings include an equivocal range, assigned when there is 
      disagreement about a technology's appropriateness and the evidence base is weak 
      or for special circumstances. It is not clear how expert consensus merges with 
      the evidence base to arrive at an equivocal rating. Quantitative benefit-risk 
      assessment (QBRA) methods may assist decision makers in this capacity. However, 
      many methods exist and it is not clear which methods are best suited for this 
      application. We perform a critical appraisal of QBRA methods and propose several 
      steps that may aid in making transparent areas of weak evidence and barriers to 
      consensus in guideline development. We identify QBRA methods with potential to 
      facilitate decision making in guideline development and build a decision aid for 
      selecting among these methods. This study identified 2 families of QBRA methods 
      suited to guideline development when expert opinion is expected to contribute 
      substantially to decision making. Key steps to deciding among QBRA methods 
      involve identifying specific benefit-risk criteria and developing a 
      state-of-evidence matrix. For equivocal ratings assigned for reasons other than 
      disagreement or weak evidence base, QBRA may not be needed. In the presence of 
      disagreement but the absence of a weak evidence base, multicriteria decision 
      analysis approaches are recommended; and in the presence of weak evidence base 
      and the absence of disagreement, incremental net health benefit alone or combined 
      with multicriteria decision analysis is recommended. Our critical appraisal 
      further extends investigation of the strengths and limitations of select QBRA 
      methods in facilitating diagnostic radiology clinical guideline development. The 
      process of using the decision aid exposes and makes transparent areas of weak 
      evidence and barriers to consensus.

AB  - We develop a prioritization framework for foodborne risks that considers public 
      health impact as well as three other factors (market impact, consumer risk 
      acceptance and perception, and social sensitivity). Canadian case studies are 
      presented for six pathogen-food combinations: Campylobacter spp. in chicken; 
      Salmonella spp. in chicken and spinach; Escherichia coli O157 in spinach and 
      beef; and Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meats. Public health impact is 
      measured by disability-adjusted life years and the cost of illness. Market impact 
      is quantified by the economic importance of the domestic market. Likert-type 
      scales are used to capture consumer perception and acceptance of risk and social 
      sensitivity to impacts on vulnerable consumer groups and industries. Risk ranking 
      is facilitated through the development of a knowledge database presented in the 
      format of info cards and the use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to 
      aggregate the four factors. Three scenarios representing different stakeholders 
      illustrate the use of MCDA to arrive at rankings of pathogen-food combinations 
      that reflect different criteria weights. The framework provides a flexible 
      instrument to support policymakers in complex risk prioritization decision making 
      when different stakeholder groups are involved and when multiple pathogen-food 
      combinations are compared.

TI  - A coupled optimization of groundwater remediation alternatives screening under 
      health risk assessment: An application to a petroleum-contaminated site in a 
      typical cold industrial region in Northeastern China.

AB  - Contaminated sites have been recognized as posing serious comprehensive social 
      and environmental issues and have earned worldwide attention. China is becoming 
      one of the largest contaminated sites remediation markets in the world and the 
      contaminated sites in northeastern China need to rehabilitate urgently. However, 
      remediation planning is often hindered by high financial costs resulting from 
      incomplete assessments of pollution and inappropriate remediation plans. In-depth 
      contaminated site assessments can provide the necessary baseline data for 
      remediation alternatives screening. Therefore, risk assessments and remediation 
      decisions will play crucial roles in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of 
      contaminated sites in China. The main objectives of this study were to present a 
      novel method for health risk assessment (HRA) and to demonstrate a multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) based on this method to select the most suitable 
      remediation alternatives of groundwater and to prioritize management of 
      contaminated site. To demonstrate the HRA and MCDA processes, a typical 
      contaminated site in Longtan, Jilin province, China, was used. The results of 
      this research indicated that Benzene (PhH) and 1,2-Dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE) 
      were the main organic pollutants and the vanillin plant in the north of the site 
      was main pollution source. Pollution migrated from the north to the south and the 
      health risk range in winter was significantly greater than in summer. Four 
      remediation alternatives were proposed on the basis of the HRA results. The MCDA 
      results showed that PRB was the most suitable technology for integrating the 
      relevant environmental, social, economic, and technical aspects required for 
      remediation. This study may help responsible agencies to strengthen local 
      risk-based program screening frameworks for contaminated sites, to promote 
      reconstruction projects, and to increase local public confidence of contaminated 
      sites remediation.

AB  - The interest on Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) for healthcare priority 
      setting has grown in popularity in the last few years. Literature shows several 
      exercises where MCDA can be used to inform different types of priorities; 
      however, there is little evidence on the feasibility of implementing this method 
      in current institutionalized decision-making processes. We examined the 
      willingness to implement MCDA as a tool to facilitate decision-making in Central 
      America and the Caribbean (CAC). We convene 41 representatives of the healthcare 
      public sector from 10 countries to explore whether they consider MCDA a robust 
      tool to be incorporated in local priority setting processes and which ongoing 
      decision-making process could be benefited from this methodology. We developed a 
      2-days hands-on training course to explain the technique, advantages and 
      limitations. The group achieved a broad consensus that MCDA can be used in CAC to 
      help priority setting processes because it introduces transparency, facilitates 
      the implementation of a systematic process and is relatively easy to explain to 
      many stakeholders. It was acknowledged that MCDA can be used to inform decisions 
      about coverage, though a major opportunity was identified to help informing other 
      decisions, such as priorities for joint purchasing and the elaboration of 
      national plans.

      participation by members of the general population. METHODS: Stimulated by a 
      preliminary ranking exercise that involved prioritizing 14 diverse technologies, 
      six focus groups discussed what matters to people when thinking about 
      technologies that should be funded. These discussions informed the specification 
      of criteria related to technologies' benefits for use in a discrete choice survey 
      designed to generate weights for each individual participant as well as mean 
      weights. A random sample of 3218 adults was invited to participate. To check 
      test-retest reliability, a subsample completed the survey twice. Cluster analysis 
      was performed to identify participants with similar patterns of weights. RESULTS: 
      Six benefits-related criteria were distilled from the focus group discussions and 
      included in the discrete choice survey, which was completed by 322 adults (10% 
      response rate). Most participants (85%) found the survey easy to understand, and 
      the survey exhibited test-retest reliability. The cluster analysis revealed that 
      participant weights are related more to idiosyncratic personal preferences than 
      to demographic and background characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology 
      enables extensive participation by members of the general population, for whom it 
      is both acceptable and reliable. Generating weights for each participant allows 
      the heterogeneity of individual preferences, and the extent to which they are 
      related to demographic and background characteristics, to be tested.

AB  - Globally the trend of water reuse has been increasing. The public perception and 
      government regulations are supportive for reclaimed water use in Canada. 
      Reclaimed water can be used in variety of applications that may have different 
      performance in economic, environmental and social dimensions for various 
      stakeholders, indicating decision on water reuse selection is complex. This 
      research proposes a multi-criteria multi-decision-makers framework combining 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and game theory for a selection of a 
      sustainable water reuse application. The proposed framework is applied to the 
      City of Penticton, BC, Canada. The evaluation criteria included were 
      environmental: fresh water saving, energy use, and carbon emissions; economic: 
      annualized life cycle cost; and social: government policy, public perception, and 
      human health risk for three stakeholders: municipality, citizens, and farm 
      operators. The game theory is applied to eight water reuse options considering a 
      cooperative game. The result shows that lawn, golf course and public park 
      irrigation and toilet flushing with an equal sharing of municipal benefits 
      between the municipality and citizens is the optimal solution. By using the 
      solution, the municipality can have an additional saving of approximately 
      $35/household/year and the citizens have to spend an additional amount of 
      approximately $100/household/year for dual plumbing of toilet and lawn for 
      reclaimed water use. The additional expenditure for the citizens is within 
      Canada's public willingness to pay an additional charge for reclaimed water use. 
      The scenario analysis shows that the weights of sustainability criteria are 
      important in decision-making. Also, the sensitivity analysis shows that the 
      change in the amount of reclaimed water availability can affect water reuse 
      sustainability performance. The proposed framework can also be used in other 
      applications by changing the number of evaluation criteria and stakeholders as 
      required.

TI  - Combining Quantitative Risk Assessment of Human Health, Food Waste, and Energy 
      Consumption: The Next Step in the Development of the Food Cold Chain?
PG  - 906-925
LID - 10.1111/risa.13199 [doi]
AB  - The preservation of perishable food via refrigeration in the supply chain is 
      essential to extend shelf life and provide consumers with safe food. However, 
      electricity consumed in refrigeration processes has an economical and an 
      environmental impact. This study focuses on the cold chain of cooked ham, 
      including transport, cold room in supermarket, display cabinet, transport by 
      consumer, and domestic refrigerator, and aims to predict the risk for human 
      health associated with Listeria monocytogenes, the amount of food wasted due to 
      the growth of spoilage bacteria, and the electrical consumption to maintain 
      product temperature through the cold chain. A set of eight intervention actions 
      were tested to evaluate their impact on the three criteria. Results show that the 
      modification of the thermostat of the domestic refrigerator has a high impact on 
      food safety and food waste and a limited impact on the electrical consumption. 
      Inversely, the modification of the airflow rate in the display cabinet has a high 
      impact on electrical consumption and a limited impact on food safety and food 
      waste. A cost-benefit analysis approach and two multicriteria decision analysis 
      methods were used to rank the intervention actions. These three methodologies 
      show that setting the thermostat of the domestic refrigerator to 4 °C presents 
      the best compromise between the three criteria. The impact of decisionmaker 
      preferences (criteria weight) and limitations of these three approaches are 
      discussed. The approaches proposed by this study may be useful in decision making 
      to evaluate global impact of intervention actions in issues involving conflicting 
      outputs.

TI  - A remote fuzzy multicriteria diagnosis of sore throat.
PG  - 656-65
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2007.0120 [doi]
AB  - A sore throat (also known as pharyngitis or tonsillitis) is most commonly caused 
      by a contagious viral infection (such as the flu, cold, or mononucleosis), 
      although more serious throat infections can be caused by a bacterial infection 
      (such as strep, mycoplasma, or Haemophilus). Bacterial sore throats respond well 
      to antibiotics, whereas viral ones do not. However, strep throat remains a 
      leading cause for physician visits, and researchers have long struggled to 
      determine how best to treat it. The current practice guidelines offer different 
      management options for adult patients presenting with a sore throat. Thus, when a 
      physician treats a patient with acute pharyngitis, the clinical decision that 
      usually needs to be made is whether the pharyngitis is attributable to group A 
      streptococci. The key concern is the degree to which the clinical possibility of 
      a group A streptococcal infection should affect clinician's decisions. To 
      determine the best treatment of pharyngitis, we conducted a multicriteria 
      decision analysis using fuzzy reasoning for remote health service delivery 
      between a healthcare provider and patients. The approach can be adopted for 
      interactive phone use or online system application. Five alternative treatment 
      options were considered, particularly: (a) no test no Rx, (b) rapid strep, (c) 
      culture, (d) rapid strep and culture, and (e) empiric Rx. Fuzzy reasoning is used 
      to examine the signs/symptoms and their ratings. The study includes seven 
      criteria factors that can be rated according to each alternative clinical 
      treatment using linguistic statements. The model shows that no test no Rx is the 
      best option for the cases of low prevalence of group A streptococcal infection. 
      Two strategies--culture and treat if positive and rapid strep with culture of 
      negative results--are equally preferable for patients with moderate prevalence 
      likelihood. Rapid strep and culture of negative results is the best management 
      strategy for patients with high population prevalence of group A streptococcal 
      infection. In conclusion, the best clinical management of patients with sore 
      throat depends on both the clinical probability of group A streptococcal 
      infection and clinical judgments that incorporate the importance ratings of the 
      individual patients as well as practice circumstances.

TI  - Prioritizing of bacterial infections transmitted through substances of human 
      origin in Europe.
PG  - 1311-1317
LID - 10.1111/trf.14036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are the pathogens most frequently transmitted through 
      substances of human origin (SoHO). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
      Control (ECDC) organized an expert consultation, with the objective of developing 
      a priority list of bacterial pathogens transmissible via SoHO. The list will be 
      used to further assess risks and determine appropriate preventive measures. STUDY 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: The 14 most frequently SoHO-transmitted bacteria identified 
      through a scoping literature review were then prioritized during an expert 
      workshop through a methodology based on multicriteria decision analysis. The 
      selection of the prioritization method was based upon an ECDC framework for best 
      practices in conducting risk-ranking exercises. Three transmission pathways, 
      blood and blood components, tissues and cells, and organs, were considered in the 
      ranking exercise. RESULTS: According to the ranking score (RS), bacteria were 
      organized within each SoHO pathway into one of four risk tiers: Tier 1 (RS ≥ 
      0.70), Tier 2 (RS = 0.60-0.69), Tier 3 (RS = 0.40-0.59), or Tier 4 (RS < 0.40). 
      The most consistently identified pathogens in the highest risk Tiers 1 and 2 of 
      all three pathways were: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Escherichia 
      coli, β-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. 
      CONCLUSION: Six bacteria were defined as being of the highest priority in respect 
      of the threat to the safety of SoHO and will be the subject of subsequent 
      in-depth risk assessments to be conducted by ECDC to identify measures to 
      mitigate the risk posed by these bacteria.

TI  - National Drug Formulary review of statin therapeutic group using the 
      multiattribute scoring tool.
PG  - 491-504
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S52078 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are extensively used in treating 
      hypercholesterolemia. The statins available in Malaysia include atorvastatin, 
      lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin. Over the 
      years, they have accumulated in the National Drug Formulary; hence, the need for 
      review. Effective selection of the best drugs to remain in the formulary can 
      become complex due to the multiple drug attributes involved, and is made worse by 
      the limited time and resources available. The multiattribute scoring tool (MAST) 
      systematizes the evaluation of the drug attributes to facilitate the drug 
      selection process. In this study, a MAST framework was developed to rank the 
      statins based on their utilities or benefits. METHODS: Published literature on 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) were studied and five sessions of expert 
      group discussions were conducted to build the MAST framework and to review the 
      evidence. The attributes identified and selected for analysis were efficacy 
      (clinical efficacy, clinical endpoints), safety (drug interactions, serious side 
      effects and documentation), drug applicability (drug strength/formulation, 
      indications, dose frequency, side effects, food-drug interactions, and dose 
      adjustments), and cost. The average weights assigned by the members for efficacy, 
      safety, drug applicability and cost were 32.6%, 26.2%, 24.1%, and 17.1%, 
      respectively. The utility values of the attributes were scored based on the 
      published evidence or/and agreements during the group discussions. The attribute 
      scores were added up to provide the total utility score. RESULTS: Using the MAST, 
      the six statins under review were successfully scored and ranked. Atorvastatin 
      scored the highest total utility score (TUS) of 84.48, followed by simvastatin 
      (83.11). Atorvastatin and simvastatin scored consistently high, even before drug 
      costs were included. The low scores on the side effects for atorvastatin were 
      compensated for by the higher scores on the clinical endpoints resulting in a 
      higher TUS for atorvastatin. Fluvastatin recorded the lowest TUS. CONCLUSION: The 
      multiattribute scoring tool was successfully applied to organize decision 
      variables in reviewing statins for the formulary. Based on the TUS, atorvastatin 
      is recommended to remain in the formulary and be considered as first-line in the 
      treatment of hypercholesterolemia.

TI  - Isoniazid prophylaxis: the importance of individual values.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - To provide insight into the decision whether to use isoniazid prophylaxis in 
      uncomplicated cases of positive tuberculin tests, the authors conducted a 
      multicriteria decision analysis using the analytic hierarchy process. If reducing 
      the chance of developing active tuberculosis is considered at least slightly more 
      important than avoiding isoniazid-related side effects, isoniazid prophylaxis is 
      the better strategy for all patients. If avoiding isoniazid-related side effects 
      is considered at least slightly more important, no prophylaxis is the better 
      strategy for all patients. If these two considerations are judged equally 
      important, the better strategy depends on patient age, the anticipated 
      effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis, and whether or not the patient is a 
      recent tuberculin convertor. The tradeoff between avoiding active tuberculosis 
      and avoiding isoniazid-related side effects is the most important factor in the 
      decision regarding the proper management of patients with positive tuberculin 
      tests. These results emphasize the importance of taking an individualized 
      approach to the management of these patients.

TI  - Identification of areas in Brazil that optimize conservation of forest carbon, 
      jaguars, and biodiversity.
PG  - 580-93
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12202 [doi]
AB  - A major question in global environmental policy is whether schemes to reduce 
      carbon pollution through forest management, such as Reducing Emissions from 
      Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), can also benefit biodiversity conservation 
      in tropical countries. We identified municipalities in Brazil that are priorities 
      for reducing rates of deforestation and thus preserving carbon stocks that are 
      also conservation targets for the endangered jaguar (Panthera onca) and 
      biodiversity in general. Preliminary statistical analysis showed that 
      municipalities with high biodiversity were positively associated with high forest 
      carbon stocks. We used a multicriteria decision analysis to identify 
      municipalities that offered the best opportunities for the conservation of forest 
      carbon stocks and biodiversity conservation under a range of scenarios with 
      different rates of deforestation and carbon values. We further categorized these 
      areas by their representativeness of the entire country (through measures such as 
      percent forest cover) and an indirect measure of cost (number of municipalities). 
      The municipalities that offered optimal co-benefits for forest carbon stocks and 
      conservation were termed REDDspots (n = 159), and their spatial distribution was 
      compared with the distribution of current and proposed REDD projects (n = 135). 
      We defined REDDspots as the municipalities that offer the best opportunities for 
      co-benefits between the conservation of forest carbon stocks, jaguars, and other 
      wildlife. These areas coincided in 25% (n = 40) of municipalities. We identified 
      a further 95 municipalities that may have the greatest potential to develop 
      additional REDD+ projects while also targeting biodiversity conservation. We 
      concluded that REDD+ strategies could be an efficient tool for biodiversity 
      conservation in key locations, especially in Amazonian and Atlantic Forest 
      biomes.

TI  - Development of CAPTSure(TM) - a new index for the assessment of pediatric 
      postthrombotic syndrome.
PG  - 2376-2385
LID - 10.1111/jth.13530 [doi]
AB  - Essentials We developed a discriminative and evaluative index for pediatric 
      postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). A Delphi-survey was used for item reduction and 
      multi-criteria decision analysis for item weighting. The new index assesses limb 
      PTS based on the relative severity of each sign and symptom. Higher scores 
      related to higher odds of parental dissatisfaction with their child's condition. 
      SUMMARY: Background Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a complication of deep vein 
      thrombosis defined by the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. We 
      developed a discriminative and evaluative index for the assessment of upper 
      extremity (UE) and lower extremity (LE) pediatric PTS. Methods The items to be 
      included in the index were voted for by 26 pediatric thrombosis experts invited 
      to participate in a Delphi survey. Subsequent item weighting was based on item 
      importance elicited by the use of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA); 122 
      healthcare providers and patients/parents were invited to participate in item 
      weighting. The implications of the overall scores were explored by comparison 
      with PTS diagnosis (independently assessed by two clinical experts) and parental 
      satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their child's current condition. Results Items 
      voted for inclusion by at least 70% of the Delphi survey respondents (81% 
      response rate) were pain, paresthesia, swelling, heaviness, endurance, collateral 
      circulation and arm circumference difference for the UE, and pain, paresthesia, 
      swelling, heaviness, tightness, tired limb, redness/purple or blotchy skin, 
      endurance, ulcers and thigh/calf circumference difference for the LE. Items were 
      then weighted by the use of MCDA (82% response rate). The index had excellent 
      discrimination for patients with/without PTS. For every 10-point increase in 
      index scores (with higher scores being indicative of worse PTS), the odds of 
      parental dissatisfaction increased by 75% and 92% in the UE and LE, respectively. 
      Conclusion We report the development of the CAPTSure™ (index for the Clinical 
      Assessment of Postthrombotic Syndrome in children), which reflects collective 
      judgement of the severity of pediatric PTS. We also provide information on the 
      meaning of the scores.

TI  - Implementing regulation policy in Brazilian health care regulation centers.
PG  - 366-79
LID - 10.1177/0272989X09344748 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of specialist medical appointments represents one of the 
      problematic areas of the Brazilian Public Health System. In this regulation 
      process, 2 issues stand out: 1) which patients should have the highest attendance 
      priority, and 2) which service suppliers can best resolve the specific health 
      problem of a patient? Based on the consideration of the existing Brazilian 
      context in the field of medical assistance, this study proposes a model designed 
      to aid regulation centers deal with the decisions related to the process of 
      allocating specialist medical appointments. The model integrates multicriteria 
      decision analysis and linear programming for the specialist medical appointment 
      allocation, in which the allocation of patients is defined as a function of the 
      relative significance of a set of criteria related to the notion of effectiveness 
      of the specialist medical care and the capability of the accredited specialist 
      health care units. The integrated model was implemented in a computer-based 
      system and validated using cardiology and vein surgery data from the regulation 
      center in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The validated computational system was applied to 
      mammography services in another regulation center. The system successfully 
      implemented a prioritization scheme, decreasing significantly the examination 
      waiting time of severe cases.

TI  - The value of information for managing contaminated sediments.
PG  - 9478-85
LID - 10.1021/es500717t [doi]
AB  - Effective management of contaminated sediments is important for long-term human 
      and environmental health, but site-management decisions are often made under high 
      uncertainty and without the help of structured decision support tools. Potential 
      trade-offs between remedial costs, environmental effects, human health risks, and 
      societal benefits, as well as fundamental differences in stakeholder priorities, 
      complicate decision making. Formal decision-analytic tools such as multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) move beyond ad hoc decision support to quantitatively 
      and holistically rank management alternatives and add transparency and 
      replicability to the evaluation process. However, even the best decisions made 
      under uncertainty may be found suboptimal in hindsight, once additional 
      scientific, social, economic, or other details become known. Value of information 
      (VoI) analysis extends MCDA by systematically evaluating the impact of 
      uncertainty on a decision. VoI prioritizes future research in terms of expected 
      decision relevance by helping decision makers estimate the likelihood that 
      additional information will improve decision confidence or change their selection 
      of a management plan. In this study, VoI analysis evaluates uncertainty, 
      estimates decision confidence, and prioritizes research to inform selection of a 
      sediment capping strategy for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and -furan contaminated 
      Grenland fjord system in southern Norway. The VoI model extends stochastic MCDA 
      to model decisions with and without simulated new information and compares 
      decision confidence across scenarios with different degrees of remaining 
      uncertainty. Results highlight opportunities for decision makers to benefit from 
      additional information by anticipating the improved decision confidence (or lack 
      thereof) expected from reducing uncertainties for each criterion or combination 
      of criteria. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of VoI analysis for 
      environmental decisions by predicting when decisions can be made confidently, for 
      prioritizing areas of research to pursue to improve decision confidence, and for 
      differentiating between decision-relevant and decision-irrelevant differences in 
      evaluation perspectives, all of which help guide meaningful deliberation toward 
      effective consensus solutions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview about the current status of health technology 
      assessment (HTA) implementation in Latin American countries and to identify 
      long-term objectives considering regional commonalities. METHODS: We conducted a 
      survey among participants of the 5th Latin American Future Trends Conference in 
      October 2015. Thirty-seven respondents from eight Latin American countries 
      provided insights about the current and preferred future status of HTA 
      implementation related to human capacity building, HTA financing, process and 
      organizational structure for HTA, scope of mandatory HTA, decision criteria, 
      standardization of HTA methodology, mandating the use of local data, and 
      international collaboration in HTA. RESULTS: Survey respondents reported 
      insufficient human resources and public investment for HTA implementation. 
      Organizational structure and legislation framework of HTA differ considerably 
      across countries. According to survey respondents, in the future policymakers 
      should rely more on the assessment of therapeutic value, cost-effectiveness, and 
      budget impact criteria by applying explicit thresholds, potentially in a 
      multicriteria decision analysis framework. HTA should not be restricted to policy 
      decisions of new technologies but it should also be used for the revision of 
      previous decisions. In addition, the quality and transparency of HTA have to be 
      strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: HTA plays an increasingly important role in Latin 
      American countries. Each country needs to record its current implementation 
      status and identify components for improvement. Duplication of efforts can be 
      reduced if international collaboration is integrated into national HTA 
      implementation.

TI  - Individual Trade-Offs Between Possible Benefits and Risks of Cancer Treatments: 
      Results from a Stated Preference Study with Patients with Multiple Myeloma.
PG  - 44-51
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0257 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to elicit the preferences of 
      patients with multiple myeloma regarding the possible benefits and risks of 
      cancer treatments and to illustrate how such data may be used to estimate 
      patients' acceptance of new treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with 
      multiple myeloma from the cancer charity Myeloma UK were invited to participate 
      in an online survey based on multicriteria decision analysis and swing weighting 
      to elicit individual stated preferences for the following attributes: (a) 1-year 
      progression-free survival (PFS, ranging from 50% to 90%), (b) mild or moderate 
      toxicity for 2 months or longer (ranging from 85% to 45%), and (c) severe or 
      life-threatening toxicity (ranging from 80% to 20%). RESULTS: A total of 560 
      participants completed the survey. The average weight given to PFS was 0.54, 
      followed by 0.32 for severe or life-threatening toxicity and 0.14 for mild or 
      moderate chronic toxicity. Participants who ranked severe or life-threatening 
      toxicity above mild or moderate chronic toxicity (56%) were more frequently 
      younger, working, and looking after dependent family members and had more 
      frequently experienced severe or life-threatening side effects. The amount of 
      weight given to PFS did not depend on any of the collected covariates. The 
      feasibility of using the collected preference data to estimate the patients' 
      acceptance of specific multiple myeloma treatments was demonstrated in a 
      subsequent decision analysis example. CONCLUSION: Stated preference studies 
      provide a systematic approach to gain knowledge about the distribution of 
      preferences in the population and about what this implies for patients' 
      acceptance of specific treatments. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study 
      demonstrated how quantitative preference statements from a large group of 
      participants can be collected through an online survey and how such information 
      may be used to explore the acceptability of specific treatments based on the 
      attributes studied. Results from such studies have the potential to become an 
      important new tool for gathering patient views and studying heterogeneity in 
      preferences in a systematic way, along with other methods, such as focus groups 
      and expert opinions.

TI  - Can Google Searches Predict the Popularity and Harm of Psychoactive Agents?
PG  - e38
LID - 10.2196/jmir.4033 [doi]
LID - e38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicting the popularity of and harm caused by psychoactive agents 
      is a serious problem that would be difficult to do by a single simple method. 
      However, because of the growing number of drugs it is very important to provide a 
      simple and fast tool for predicting some characteristics of these substances. We 
      were inspired by the Google Flu Trends study on the activity of the influenza 
      virus, which showed that influenza virus activity worldwide can be monitored 
      based on queries entered into the Google search engine. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to 
      propose a fast method for ranking the most popular and most harmful drugs based 
      on easily available data gathered from the Internet. METHODS: We used the Google 
      search engine to acquire data for the ranking lists. Subsequently, using the 
      resulting list and the frequency of hits for the respective psychoactive drugs 
      combined with the word "harm" or "harmful", we estimated quickly how much harm is 
      associated with each drug. RESULTS: We ranked the most popular and harmful 
      psychoactive drugs. As we conducted the research over a period of several months, 
      we noted that the relative popularity indexes tended to change depending on when 
      we obtained them. This suggests that the data may be useful in monitoring changes 
      over time in the use of each of these psychoactive agents. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      correlate well with the results from a multicriteria decision analysis of drug 
      harms in the United Kingdom. We showed that Google search data can be a valuable 
      source of information to assess the popularity of and harm caused by psychoactive 
      agents and may help in monitoring drug use trends.

BTI - The impact of home energy efficiency interventions and winter fuel payments on 
      winter- and cold-related mortality and morbidity in England: a natural equipment 
      mixed-methods study
AB  - BACKGROUND: England, and the UK more generally, has a large burden of winter- and 
      cold-related mortality/morbidity in comparison with nearby countries in 
      continental Europe. Improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock may help 
      to reduce this, as well as being important for climate change and energy security 
      objectives. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of home energy efficiency (HEE) 
      interventions on winter- and cold-related mortality/morbidity, including 
      assessing the impact of winter fuel payments (WFPs) and fuel costs. DESIGN: A 
      mixed-methods study – an epidemiological time-series analysis, an analysis of 
      data on HEE interventions, the development and application of modelling methods 
      including a multicriteria decision analysis and an in-depth interview study of 
      householders. SETTING: England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: The population of England. 
      In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 households (2–4 participants each) and 
      41 individuals in three geographical regions. INTERVENTIONS: HEE interventions. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality, morbidity and intervention-related changes to 
      the home indoor environment. DATA SOURCES: The Homes Energy Efficiency Database, 
      mortality and hospital admissions data and weather (temperature) data. RESULTS: 
      There has been a progressive decline in cold-related deaths since the mid-1970s. 
      Since the introduction of WFPs, the gradient of association between winter cold 
      and mortality [2.00%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74% to 2.28%] per degree 
      Celsius fall in temperature is somewhat weaker (i.e. that the population is less 
      vulnerable to cold) than in earlier years (2.37%, 95% CI 0.22% to 2.53%). There 
      is also evidence that years with above-average fuel costs were associated with 
      higher vulnerability to outdoor cold. HEE measures installed in England in 
      2002–10 have had a relatively modest impact in improving the indoor environment. 
      The gains in winter temperatures (around +0.09 °C on a day with maximum outdoor 
      temperature of 5 °C) are associated with an estimated annual reduction of ≈280 
      cold-related deaths in England (an eventual maximum annual impact of 4000 
      life-years gained), but these impacts may be appreciably smaller than those of 
      changes in indoor air quality. Modelling studies indicate the potential 
      importance of the medium- and longer-term impacts that HEE measures have on 
      health, which are not observable in short-term studies. They also suggest that 
      HEE improvements of similar annualised cost to current WFPs would achieve greater 
      improvements in health while reducing (rather than increasing) carbon dioxide 
      emissions. In-depth interviews suggest four distinct householder framings of HEE 
      measures (as home improvement, home maintenance, subsidised public goods and 
      contributions to sustainability), which do not dovetail with current 
      ‘consumerist’ national policy and may have implications for the uptake of HEE 
      measures. LIMITATIONS: The quantification of intervention impacts in this 
      national study is reliant on various indirect/model-based assessments. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Larger-scale changes are required to the housing stock in England if 
      the full potential benefits for improving health and for reaching increasingly 
      important climate change mitigation targets are to be realised. FUTURE WORK: 
      Studies based on data linkage at individual dwelling level to examine health 
      impacts. There is a need for empirical assessment of HEE interventions on indoor 
      air quality. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for 
      Health Research (NIHR) Public Health Research programme and will be published in 
      full in Public Health Research; Vol. 6, No. 11. See the NIHR Journals Library

AB  - Given recent developments in the United States, where professional clinical 
      societies have attempted to define "value" and consider it in their deliberations 
      about appropriate care, this thematic article describes those recent specialty 
      society efforts in the United States in cardiology and oncology and the 
      multispecialty efforts in the United Kingdom for over 10 years. Despite our high 
      levels of health spending, and our field's long and consistent approach to the 
      basic tools of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), US private and public payers 
      are not routinely or explicitly using CEAs in their reimbursement decisions. This 
      is a puzzle that raises the following question: Why does the United States have 
      so many skilled pharmacoeconomic practitioners and produce so many CEAs given 
      this apparent lack of interest and trust? There are multiple reasons, but the 
      lack of incentives to use the information certainly matters. This article 
      identifies and discusses a number of key issues and challenges for incorporating 
      CEA into US clinical guidelines development: potential bias in 
      manufacturer-sponsored CEAs, the role of societal perspective, payer-subscriber 
      and physician-patient agency relationships, the need for disease area CEA studies 
      and modeling, patient heterogeneity, investigators' conflicts of interest, 
      assessing the quality of economic studies, and aggregation of information using 
      multicriteria decision analysis. These developments suggest that the application 
      of CEA in health care decision making in the United States is evolving and may be 
      approaching a tipping point. With increasing pressures on drug prices, perhaps 
      reflecting challenges to industry sustainability, payers, providers, and patients 
      are looking for value for money. CEA should be an important part of this process.

TI  - Incorporating equity-efficiency interactions in cost-effectiveness analysis-three 
      approaches applied to breast cancer control.
PG  - 573-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00718.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The past decade, medical technology assessment focused on 
      cost-effectiveness analysis, yet there is an increasing need to consider equity 
      implications of health interventions as well. This article addresses three 
      equity-efficiency trade-off methods proposed in the literature. Moreover, it 
      demonstrates their impact on cost-effectiveness analyses in current breast cancer 
      control options for women of different age groups. METHODS: We adapted an 
      existing breast cancer model to estimate cost-effectiveness and equity effects of 
      breast cancer interventions. We applied three methods to quantify the 
      equity-efficiency trade-offs: 1) targeting specific groups, comparing disparities 
      at baseline and in different intervention scenarios; 2) equity weighting, valuing 
      low and high health gains differently; and 3) multicriteria decision analysis, 
      weighing multiple equity and efficiency criteria. We compared the resulting 
      composite league tables of all approaches. RESULTS: The approaches show that a 
      comprehensive breast cancer program, including screening, for women below 75 
      years of age was most attractive in both the group targeting approach and the 
      equity weighting approach. Such control programs would reduce disparities with 
      56% and at euro1908 per equity quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the 
      multicriteria approach, a comprehensive treatment program for women below 75 
      years of age and treatment in stage III breast cancer were most attractive, with 
      both an 82% selection probability, followed by screening programs for the two age 
      groups. CONCLUSION: In the three equity weighing approaches, targeting women 
      below 75 years of age was more cost-effective and led to more equitable 
      distributions of health. This likely is similar in other fatal diseases with 
      similar age distributions. The approaches may lead to different outcomes in 
      nonfatal disease.

TI  - An approach for mapping the vulnerability of European Union soils to antibiotic 
      contamination.
PG  - 672-9
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.032 [doi]
AB  - Release of antibiotics into the environment through the agricultural reuse of 
      animal manure is considered a cause of chronic environmental exposure that often 
      leads to adverse ecotoxicological effects, as well as to the introduction of 
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment. The vulnerability of soil to 
      antibiotic contamination plays a major role in determining the extent of the 
      contamination and the likelihood of the emergence of antibiotic resistance and 
      the appearance of ecotoxicological effects. It depends on soil characteristics, 
      which vary across Europe, and antibiotic characteristics, which vary across drug 
      classes. Understanding how soil vulnerability varies geographically for different 
      veterinary medicinal products would be very useful for resource allocation among 
      surveillance programmes. This paper performs risk analysis of the EU region for 
      12 antimicrobials using a spatial assessment performed in four steps. First, 
      antibiotic release was estimated based on livestock density. Then exposure was 
      estimated based on antimicrobial soil contamination. Third, consequences were 
      modelled based on soil uses. Finally, risk was estimated by combining release, 
      exposure and consequences using spatial multicriteria decision analysis. A final 
      risk value for soil vulnerability was calculated for each antibiotic studied and 
      displayed in chloropletic maps (ArcGIS 9.3). Furthermore, the Getis-Ord Gi 
      statistic was used to identify clusters of areas at high risk for antibiotic soil 
      contamination. Enrofloxacin was the highest-risk antibiotic in the European 
      Union, followed by tetracyclines, tylosin and sulfodiazine. The highest risk 
      values were found in Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany 
      and the UK. The results suggest that this methodology can be used successfully 
      for evaluating the contamination potential of antibiotics over large areas with 
      limited input data. This work is a preliminary step towards prioritising the use 
      of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs), orientating monitoring studies and 
      antimicrobial surveillance programmes, and informing sustainable decision-making 
      for interventions designed to mitigate the risk of VMPs.

TI  - Optimization of the decision-making process for the selection of therapeutics to 
      undergo clinical testing for spinal cord injury in the North American Clinical 
      Trials Network.
PG  - 94-101
LID - 10.3171/2012.5.AOSPINE1289 [doi]
AB  - The North American Clinical Trials Network (NACTN) includes 9 clinical centers 
      funded by the US Department of Defense and the Christopher Reeve Paralysis 
      Foundation. Its purpose is to accelerate clinical testing of promising 
      therapeutics in spinal cord injury (SCI) through the development of a robust 
      interactive infrastructure. This structure includes key committees that serve to 
      provide longitudinal guidance to the Network. These committees include the 
      Executive, Data Management, and Neurological Outcome Assessments Committees, and 
      the Therapeutic Selection Committee (TSC), which is the subject of this 
      manuscript. The NACTN brings unique elements to the SCI field. The Network's 
      stability is not restricted to a single clinical trial. Network members have 
      diverse expertise and include experts in clinical care, clinical trial design and 
      methodology, pharmacology, preclinical and clinical research, and advanced 
      rehabilitation techniques. Frequent systematic communication is assigned a high 
      value, as is democratic process, fairness and efficiency of decision making, and 
      resource allocation. This article focuses on how decision making occurs within 
      the TSC to rank alternative therapeutics according to 2 main variables: quality 
      of the preclinical data set, and fit with the Network's aims and capabilities. 
      This selection process is important because if the Network's resources are 
      committed to a therapeutic, alternatives cannot be pursued. A proposed 
      methodology includes a multicriteria decision analysis that uses a 
      Multi-Attribute Global Inference of Quality matrix to quantify the process. To 
      rank therapeutics, the TSC uses a series of consensus steps designed to reduce 
      individual and group bias and limit subjectivity. Given the difficulties 
      encountered by industry in completing clinical trials in SCI, stable 
      collaborative not-for-profit consortia, such as the NACTN, may be essential to 
      clinical progress in SCI. The evolution of the NACTN also offers substantial 
      opportunity to refine decision making and group dynamics. Making the best 
      possible decisions concerning therapeutics selection for trial testing is a 
      cornerstone of the Network's function.

TI  - Developing a Social, Cultural and Economic Report Card for a Regional Industrial 
      Harbour.
PG  - e0148271
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148271 [doi]
LID - e0148271
AB  - Report cards are increasingly used to provide ongoing snap-shots of progress 
      towards specific ecosystem health goals, particularly in coastal regions where 
      planners need to balance competing demands for coastal resources from a range of 
      industries. While most previous report cards focus on the biophysical components 
      of the system, there is a growing interest in including the social and economic 
      implications of ecosystem management to provide a greater social-ecological 
      system understanding. Such a report card was requested on the Gladstone Harbour 
      area in central Queensland, Australia. Gladstone Harbour adjoins the southern 
      Great Barrier Reef, and is also a major industrial and shipping port. Balancing 
      social, economic and environmental interests is therefore of great concern to the 
      regional managers. While environmental benchmarking procedures are well 
      established within Australia (and elsewhere), a method for assessing social and 
      economic performance of coastal management is generally lacking. The key aim of 
      this study was to develop and pilot a system for the development of a report card 
      relating to appropriate cultural, social and economic objectives. The approach 
      developed uses a range of multicriteria decision analysis methods to assess and 
      combine different qualitative and quantitative measures, including the use of 
      Bayesian Belief Networks to combine the different measures and provide an overall 
      quantitative score for each of the key management objectives. The approach 
      developed is readily transferable for purposes of similar assessments in other 
      regions.

TI  - Benefits and risks of emerging technologies: integrating life cycle assessment 
      and decision analysis to assess lumber treatment alternatives.
PG  - 11543-50
LID - 10.1021/es501996s [doi]
AB  - Assessing the best options among emerging technologies (e.g., new chemicals, 
      nanotechnologies) is complicated because of trade-offs across benefits and risks 
      that are difficult to quantify given limited and fragmented availability of 
      information. This study demonstrates the integration of multicriteria decision 
      analysis (MCDA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to address technology alternative 
      selection decisions. As a case study, prioritization of six lumber treatment 
      alternatives [micronized copper quaternary (MCQ); alkaline copper quaternary 
      (ACQ); water-borne copper naphthenate (CN); oil-borne copper naphthenate (CNo); 
      water-borne copper quinolate (CQ); and water-borne zinc naphthenate (ZN)] for 
      military use are considered. Multiattribute value theory (MAVT) is used to derive 
      risk and benefit scores. Risk scores are calculated using a cradle-to-gate LCA. 
      Benefit scores are calculated by scoring of cost, durability, and corrosiveness 
      criteria. Three weighting schemes are used, representing Environmental, Military 
      and Balanced stakeholder perspectives. Aggregated scores from all three 
      perspectives show CQ to be the least favorable alterative. MCQ is identified as 
      the most favorable alternative from the Environmental stakeholder perspective. 
      From the Military stakeholder perspective, ZN is determined to be the most 
      favorable alternative, followed closely by MCQ. This type of scoring and ranking 
      of multiple heterogeneous criteria in a systematic and transparent way 
      facilitates better justification of technology selection and regulation.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: In clinical guideline or criteria development 
      processes, such as those used in developing American College of Radiology 
      Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC), experts subjectively evaluate benefits and 
      risks associated with imaging tests and make complex decisions about imaging 
      recommendations. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) decomposes complex 
      decisions into structured smaller decisions, incorporates quantitative evidence 
      and qualitative expert opinion, and promotes structured consensus building. AHP 
      may supplement and/or improve the transparency of expert opinion contributions to 
      developing guidelines or criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct an empirical 
      test using health services research tools, we convened a mock ACR AC panel of 
      emergency department radiology and nonradiology physicians to evaluate by 
      multicriteria decision analysis, the relative appropriateness of imaging tests 
      for diagnosing suspected appendicitis. Panel members selected benefit-risk 
      criteria via an online survey and assessed contrast-enhanced computed tomography, 
      magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound using an AHP-based software. 
      Participants were asked whether the process was manageable, transparent, and 
      improved shared understanding. Priority scores were converted to rankings and 
      compared to the rank order of ACR AC ratings. RESULTS: When compared to magnetic 
      resonance and ultrasound imaging, participants agreed with the ACR AC that 
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the most appropriate test. Contrary to 
      the ACR AC ratings, study results suggest that magnetic resonance is preferable 
      to ultrasound. When compared to nonradiologists, radiologists' priority scores 
      reflect a stronger preference for computed tomography. CONCLUSIONS: Study 
      participants addressed decision-making challenges using a relatively efficient 
      data collection mechanism, suggesting that AHP may benefit the ACR AC guideline 
      development process in identifying the relative appropriateness of imaging tests. 
      With additional development, AHP may improve transparency when expert opinion is 
      used in clinical guideline or appropriateness criteria development.

TI  - MCDA swing weighting and discrete choice experiments for elicitation of patient 
      benefit-risk preferences: a critical assessment.
PG  - 1483-1491
LID - 10.1002/pds.4255 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Multiple criteria decision analysis swing weighting (SW) and discrete 
      choice experiments (DCE) are appropriate methods for capturing patient 
      preferences on treatment benefit-risk trade-offs. This paper presents a 
      qualitative comparison of the 2 methods. METHODS: We review and critically assess 
      similarities and differences of SW and DCE based on 6 aspects: comprehension by 
      study participants, cognitive biases, sample representativeness, ability to 
      capture heterogeneity in preferences, reliability and validity, and robustness of 
      the results. RESULTS: The SW choice task can be more difficult, but the workshop 
      context in which SW is conducted may provide more support to patients who are 
      unfamiliar with the end points being evaluated or who have cognitive impairments. 
      Both methods are similarly prone to a number of biases associated with preference 
      elicitation, and DCE is prone to simplifying heuristics, which limits its 
      application with large number of attributes. The low cost per patient of the DCE 
      means that it can be better at achieving a representative sample, though SW does 
      not require such large sample sizes due to exact nature of the collected 
      preference data. This also means that internal validity is automatically enforced 
      with SW, while the internal validity of DCE results needs to be assessed 
      manually. CONCLUSIONS: Choice between the 2 methods depends on characteristics of 
      the benefit-risk assessment, especially on how difficult the trade-offs are for 
      the patients to make and how many patients are available. Although there exist 
      some empirical studies on many of the evaluation aspects, critical evidence gaps 
      remain.

AB  - Brazil has an increasing rate of e-waste generation, but there are currently few 
      adequate management systems in operation, with the largest share of Waste 
      Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) going to landfill sites or entering 
      informal chains. The National Solid Waste Policy (2010) enforces the 
      implementation of reverse logistics systems under the shared responsibility of 
      consumers, companies and governments. The objective of this paper is to assess 
      sustainability and prioritise system alternatives for potential implementation in 
      the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Sustainability criteria and decision 
      alternatives were defined by elicitation of stakeholders. The adopted 
      multicriteria approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with qualitative 
      evaluations by a small sample of regional experts with knowledge of the problem. 
      The recommended system consists of a hybrid WEEE collection scheme with delivery 
      points at shops, metro stations and neighbourhood centres; a pre-treatment phase 
      with the involvement of private companies, cooperatives and social enterprises; 
      and full recycling of all components in the country.

TI  - A methodology of evaluating sustainability index of a biomass processing 
      enterprise: a case study of native cow dung-urine biorefinery.
PG  - 27435-27448
LID - 10.1007/s11356-019-06309-1 [doi]
AB  - Agriculture and its allied sector contribute significantly to the gross domestic 
      product of every country. Several small-scale enterprises engaged in waste 
      biomass processing have been setup recently. Such industrial setups not only help 
      in solving the waste management issues but also play an important role in 
      offering employment at the grass root level generating a significant social 
      impact along with economic advantage to the local entrepreneur. Hence, assessment 
      of such biomass processing enterprise (BPE) based on economic, environment, and 
      social parameters has become necessary. In this paper, a general framework for 
      sustainability assessment is discussed using a case study of cow dung-urine 
      biorefinery as a representative BPE. Real-time data of BPE has been collected for 
      evaluation and a sustainability index (SI) is evaluated using multicriteria 
      decision method. The SI is calculated as per the weightage assigned and value 
      function of the indicator and criteria. The SI for the BPE was observed to be 
      0.69 for the chosen set of criteria and indicator and weightages. A sensitivity 
      analysis has been performed to check the dependence of the results on the 
      weightages assigned to various criteria and indicators. It was also observed that 
      the results were more sensitive to the indicators having a low value function.

TI  - Spatial modelling for low pathogenicity avian influenza virus at the interface of 
      wild birds and backyard poultry.
PG  - 1493-1505
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13136 [doi]
AB  - Low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) is endemic in wild birds and 
      poultry in Argentina, and active surveillance has been in place to prevent any 
      eventual virus mutation into a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), 
      which is exotic in this country. Risk mapping can contribute effectively to 
      disease surveillance and control systems, but it has proven a very challenging 
      task in the absence of disease data. We used a combination of expert opinion 
      elicitation, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and ecological niche 
      modelling (ENM) to identify the most suitable areas for the occurrence of LPAIV 
      at the interface between backyard domestic poultry and wild birds in Argentina. 
      This was achieved by calculating a spatially explicit risk index. As evidenced by 
      the validation and sensitivity analyses, our model was successful in identifying 
      high-risk areas for LPAIV occurrence. Also, we show that the risk for virus 
      occurrence is significantly higher in areas closer to commercial poultry farms. 
      Although the active surveillance systems have been successful in detecting 
      LPAIV-positive backyard farms and wild birds in Argentina, our predictions 
      suggest that surveillance efforts in those compartments could be improved by 
      including high-risk areas identified by our model. Our research provides a tool 
      to guide surveillance activities in the future, and presents a mixed 
      methodological approach which could be implemented in areas where the disease is 
      exotic or rare and a knowledge-driven modelling method is necessary.

TI  - Decision support-oriented selection of remediation technologies to rehabilitate 
      contaminated sites.
PG  - 273-85
AB  - A methodology for selecting remediation technologies is presented as part of a 
      decision support system for the rehabilitation of contaminated sites. It includes 
      2 steps: In the 1st step, a pool of suitable technologies is selected within a 
      technologies database according to their applicability to site-specific 
      conditions; in the 2nd step, the selected technologies: are ranked according to a 
      multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. The MCDA was applied to allow 
      for a transparent procedure and for the integration of expert analyses. The 
      methodology was implemented in a previously developed georeferenced information 
      system-based decision support system for the rehabilitation of contaminated sites 
      and then applied to a case study (Porto Marghera, Venice, Italy). On the basis of 
      the obtained results, the proposed methodology appeared suitable to select 
      remediation technologies according to both technical features and requirements of 
      available technologies, as well as site-specific environmental conditions of the 
      site of concern, such as chemical contamination levels and remediation 
      objectives.

TI  - Capacity Building for HTA Implementation in Middle-Income Countries: The Case of 
      Hungary.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Middle-income countries often have no clear roadmap for 
      implementation of health technology assessment (HTA) in policy decisions. 
      Examples from high-income countries may not be relevant, as lower income 
      countries cannot allocate so much financial and human resources for 
      substantiating policy decisions with evidence. Therefore, HTA implementation 
      roadmaps from other smaller-size, lower-income countries can be more relevant 
      examples for countries with similar cultural environment and economic status. 
      METHODS: We reviewed the capacity building process for HTA implementation in 
      Hungary with special focus on the role of ISPOR Hungary Chapter. RESULTS: HTA 
      implementation in Hungary started with capacity building at universities with the 
      support of the World Bank in the mid 90's, followed by the publication of 
      methodological guidelines for conducting health economic evaluations in 2002. The 
      Hungarian Health Economics Association (META) - established in 2003 - has been 
      recognized as a driving force of HTA implementation. META became the official 
      regional ISPOR Chapter of Hungary in 2007. In 2004 the National Health Insurance 
      Fund Administration made the cost-effectiveness and budget impact criteria 
      compulsory prior to granting reimbursement to new pharmaceuticals. An Office of 
      Health Technology Assessment was established for the critical appraisal of 
      economic evaluations submitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers. In 2010 
      multicriteria decision analysis was introduced for new hospital technologies. 
      CONCLUSION: The economic crisis may create an opportunity to further strengthen 
      the evidence base of health care decision-making in Hungary. In the forthcoming 
      period ISPOR Hungary Chapter may play an even more crucial role in improving the 
      standards of HTA implementation and facilitating international collaboration with 
      other CEE countries.

TI  - A multiattribute model for evaluating the benefit-risk profiles of treatment 
      alternatives.
PG  - 104-15
LID - 10.1177/0272989X08323299 [doi]
AB  - The assessment of the benefits and risks associated with a medicine's use 
      requires careful consideration of a wealth of information of varying format and 
      quality, ranging from efficacy and safety data derived from randomized clinical 
      trials to statistical results from health outcomes studies to spontaneously 
      reported adverse events. Contrary to the expectations of patients, physicians, 
      and regulators, the literature offers little guidance as to how to strike an 
      appropriate balance between benefit and risk. Although a qualitative listing of a 
      medicine's benefits and risks is useful, much could be gained from a systematic 
      and transparent process to evaluate a medicine's pre- and postmarketing 
      performance. The authors propose a representational model based on multicriteria 
      decision analysis that can incorporate both evaluative judgments from different 
      perspectives (e.g., physician, patient) and quantitative data to inform tradeoffs 
      between multiple benefit and multiple risk elements in a logically consistent and 
      transparent manner. The model is designed to highlight the relative merits and 
      deficits of treatment alternatives in well-defined and specific contexts. It is 
      intended to serve as a common platform to facilitate focused benefit-risk 
      tradeoff discussions between scientists, physicians, regulatory authorities, and 
      pharmaceutical companies, and to assist in the communication of clear and 
      consistent messages regarding those tradeoffs.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of a spatial multicriteria model for highly pathogenic 
      avian influenza H5N1 in Thailand, and application in Cambodia.
PG  - 31096
LID - 10.1038/srep31096 [doi]
LID - 31096
AB  - The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 (HPAI) virus is now considered endemic 
      in several Asian countries. In Cambodia, the virus has been circulating in the 
      poultry population since 2004, with a dramatic effect on farmers' livelihoods and 
      public health. In Thailand, surveillance and control are still important to 
      prevent any new H5N1 incursion. Risk mapping can contribute effectively to 
      disease surveillance and control systems, but is a very challenging task in the 
      absence of reliable disease data. In this work, we used spatial multicriteria 
      decision analysis (MCDA) to produce risk maps for HPAI H5N1 in poultry. We aimed 
      to i) evaluate the performance of the MCDA approach to predict areas suitable for 
      H5N1 based on a dataset from Thailand, comparing the predictive capacities of two 
      sources of a priori knowledge (literature and experts), and ii) apply the best 
      method to produce a risk map for H5N1 in poultry in Cambodia. Our results showed 
      that the expert-based model had a very high predictive capacity in Thailand 
      (AUC = 0.97). Applied in Cambodia, MCDA mapping made it possible to identify 
      hotspots suitable for HPAI H5N1 in the Tonlé Sap watershed, around the cities of 
      Battambang and Kampong Cham, and along the Vietnamese border.

AB  - In this study we perform ranking of analytical procedures for 
      3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol determination in soy sauces by PROMETHEE method. 
      Multicriteria decision analysis was performed for three different scenarios - 
      metrological, economic and environmental, by application of different weights to 
      decision making criteria. All three scenarios indicate capillary 
      electrophoresis-based procedure as the most preferable. Apart from that the 
      details of ranking results differ for these three scenarios. The second run of 
      rankings was done for scenarios that include metrological, economic and 
      environmental criteria only, neglecting others. These results show that green 
      analytical chemistry-based selection correlates with economic, while there is no 
      correlation with metrological ones. This is an implication that green analytical 
      chemistry can be brought into laboratories without analytical performance costs 
      and it is even supported by economic reasons.

TI  - Potential Criteria for Frameworks to Support the Evaluation of Innovative 
      Medicines in Upper Middle-Income Countries-A Systematic Literature Review on 
      Value Frameworks and Multi-Criteria Decision Analyses.
PG  - 1203
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2020.01203 [doi]
LID - 1203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), a formal decision support 
      framework, has been growing in popularity recently in the field of health care. 
      MCDA can support pricing and reimbursement decisions on the macro level, which is 
      of great importance especially in countries with more limited resources. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to facilitate the development 
      of future MCDA frameworks, by proposing a set of criteria focusing on the 
      purchasing decisions of single-source innovative pharmaceuticals in upper 
      middle-income countries. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted on 
      the decision criteria included in value frameworks (VFs) or MCDA tools. Scopus, 
      Medline, databases of universities, websites of Health Technology Assessment 
      Agencies, and other relevant organizations were included in the search. Double 
      title-abstract screening and double full-text review were conducted, and all 
      extracted data were double-checked. A team of researchers performed the merging 
      and selection process of the extracted criteria. RESULTS: A total of 1,878 
      articles entered the title and abstract screening. From these, 341 were eligible 
      to the full-text review, and 36 were included in the final data extraction phase. 
      From these articles 394 criteria were extracted in total. After deduplication and 
      clustering, 26 different criteria were identified. After the merging and 
      selection process, a set of 16 general criteria was proposed. CONCLUSION: Based 
      on the results of the systematic literature review, a pool of 16 criteria was 
      selected. This can serve as a starting point for constructing MCDA frameworks in 
      upper middle-income countries after careful adaptation to the local context.

TI  - An Integrated Approach for the Environmental Characterization of a Wide 
      Potentially Contaminated Area in Southern Italy.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14070693 [doi]
LID - 693
AB  - This paper deals with the environmental characterization of a large and densely 
      populated area, with a poor reputation for contamination, considering the 
      contribution of environmental features (air, soil, soil hydraulic and 
      groundwater) and the potential effects on human health. The use of Geographic 
      Information System (GIS) has made possible a georeferenced inventory and, by 
      overlaying environmental information, an operational synthesis of comprehensive 
      environmental conditions. The cumulative effects on environmental features were 
      evaluated, taking into account superposition effects, by means of the Spatial 
      MultiCriteria Decision Analysis (S-MCDA). The application of the S-MCDA for 
      converging the combination of heterogeneous factors, related to soil, land and 
      water, deeply studied by heterogeneous groups of experts, constitutes the novelty 
      of the paper. The results confirmed an overall higher potential of exposure to 
      contaminants in the environment and higher mortality rates in the study area for 
      some tumours, but hospital admissions for tumours were generally similar to the 
      regional trend. Besides, mortality data may be strictly dependent on the poor 
      socioeconomic conditions, quality of therapy and a lack of welfare in the area 
      relative to the rest of Italy. Finally, as regards the possible relationship 
      between presence of contaminants in the environment and health conditions of the 
      population no definite conclusions can be drawn, although the present study 
      encourages the use of the new proposed methods, that increase the possibilities 
      for studying the combined effect of more environmental factors.

TI  - Identifying Areas Suitable for the Occurrence of Rift Valley Fever in North 
      Africa: Implications for Surveillance.
PG  - 658-674
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12331 [doi]
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that has caused 
      widespread outbreaks throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, with serious 
      consequences for livestock-based economies and public health. Although there have 
      never been any reports of RVF in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, it is a 
      priority disease in the Maghreb, due to the threat of introduction of the virus 
      through transboundary livestock movements or infected mosquito vectors. However, 
      the implementation of surveillance activities and early warning contingency plans 
      requires better knowledge of the epidemiological situation. We conducted a 
      multicriteria decision analysis, integrating host distribution with a combination 
      of important ecological factors that drive mosquito abundance, to identify 
      hotspots and suitable time periods for RVF enzootic circulation (i.e. stable 
      transmission at a low to moderate level for an extended period of time) and an 
      RVF epizootic event (i.e. a sudden occurrence of a large number of infected 
      animals over a large geographic area) in the Maghreb. We also modelled vector 
      species distribution using available information on vector presence and habitat 
      preference. We found that the northern regions of the Maghreb were moderately 
      suitable for RVF enzootics, but highly suitable for RVF epizootics. The vector 
      species distribution model identified these regions as the most favourable 
      mosquito habitats. Due to the low density of animal hosts and arid conditions, 
      the desert region showed low RVF suitability, except in oases. However, the 
      presence of competent vectors in putative unsuitable areas underlines the need 
      for further assessments of mosquito habitat preference. This study produced 
      monthly RVF suitability maps useful for animal health managers and veterinary 
      services involved in designing risk-based surveillance programmes. The 
      suitability maps can be further enhanced using existing country-specific sources 
      of information and by incorporating knowledge - as it becomes available - on the 
      epidemiology of the disease and distribution of vectors in the Maghreb.

AB  - The rapid industrial development and urbanization processes that occurred in 
      China over the past 30years has increased dramatically the consumption of natural 
      resources and raw materials, thus exacerbating the human pressure on 
      environmental ecosystems. In result, large scale environmental pollution of soil, 
      natural waters and urban air were recorded. The development of effective 
      industrial planning to support regional sustainable economy development has 
      become an issue of serious concern for local authorities which need to select 
      safe sites for new industrial settlements (i.e. industrial plants) according to 
      assessment approaches considering cumulative impacts, synergistic pollution 
      effects and risks of accidental releases. In order to support decision makers in 
      the development of efficient and effective regional land-use plans encompassing 
      the identification of suitable areas for new industrial settlements and areas in 
      need of intervention measures, this study provides a spatial regional risk 
      assessment methodology which integrates relative risk assessment (RRA) and 
      socio-economic assessment (SEA) and makes use of spatial analysis (GIS) 
      methodologies and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The proposed 
      methodology was applied to the Chinese region of Hulunbeier which is located in 
      eastern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, adjacent to the Republic of Mongolia. 
      The application results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed 
      methodology in the identification of the most hazardous and risky industrial 
      settlements, the most vulnerable regional receptors and the regional districts 
      which resulted to be the most relevant for intervention measures since they are 
      characterized by high regional risk and excellent socio-economic development 
      conditions.

TI  - Multicriteria evaluation of simulated logging scenarios in a tropical rain 
      forest.
PG  - 321-33
AB  - Forest growth models are useful tools for investigating the long-term impacts of 
      logging. In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were 
      assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by 
      FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth 
      is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and 
      space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four 
      different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at 
      Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging 
      cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the 
      impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in 
      species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time 
      to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly 
      show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more 'efficient' than the others, 
      since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly 
      reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a 
      desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged 
      forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. 
      Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities 
      cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging 
      techniques.

LID - 10.1093/heapol/czu123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Macroeconomic growth in China enables significant progress in health 
      care and public health. It faces difficult choices regarding access, quality and 
      affordability, while dealing with the increasing burden of chronic diseases. 
      Policymakers are pressured to make complex decisions while implementing health 
      strategies. This study shows how this process could be structured and reports the 
      specific equity and efficiency preferences among Chinese policymakers. METHODS: 
      In total, 78 regional, provincial and national level policymakers with 
      considerable experience participated in a discrete choice experiment, weighting 
      the relative importance of six policy attributes describing equity and 
      efficiency. Results from a conditional logistic model are presented for the six 
      criteria, measuring the associated weights. Observed and unobserved 
      heterogeneities were incorporated and tested in the model. Findings are used to 
      give an example of ranking health interventions in relation to the present 
      disease burden in China. RESULTS: In general, respondents showed strong 
      preference for efficiency criteria i.e. total beneficiaries and 
      cost-effectiveness as the most important attributes in decision making over 
      equity criteria. Hence, priority interventions would be those conditions that are 
      most prevalent in the country and cost least per health gain. CONCLUSION: 
      Although efficiency criteria override equity ones, major health threats in China 
      would be targeted. Multicriteria decision analysis makes explicit important 
      trade-offs between efficiency and equity, leading to explicit, transparent and 
      rational policy making.

AB  - Use of participatory stakeholder engagement processes could be important to 
      reduce the risk of potential conflicts in managing contaminated sites. Most 
      stakeholder engagement techniques are qualitative in nature and require 
      experienced facilitators. This study proposes a multicriteria involvement process 
      to enhance transparency and stakeholder participation and applies it to a 
      contaminated sediment management case study for Bergen Harbor, Norway. The 
      suggested multicriteria involvement process builds on the quantitative principles 
      of multicriteria decision analysis and also incorporates group interaction and 
      learning through qualitative participatory methods. Three different advisory 
      groups consisting of local residents, local stakeholders, and nonresident 
      sediment experts were invited to participate in a stakeholder engagement process 
      to provide consensual comparative advice on sediment remediation alternatives. In 
      order for stakeholders or residents to be able to embrace a complex decision such 
      as selection of remediation alternatives, the involvement process with lateral 
      learning, combined with multicriteria decision analysis providing structure, 
      robustness and transparent documentation was preferable. In addition, a 
      multicriteria involvement process resulted in consistent ranking of remediation 
      alternatives across residents, stakeholder, and experts, relative to individual 
      intuitive ranking without the multicriteria involvement process.

TI  - A geographical information system-based multicriteria evaluation to map areas at 
      risk for Rift Valley fever vector-borne transmission in Italy.
PG  - 14-23
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12156 [doi]
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe mosquito-borne disease that is caused by a 
      Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae) and affects domestic ruminants and humans. Recently, 
      its distribution widened, threatening Europe. The probability of the introduction 
      and large-scale spread of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Europe is low, but 
      localized RVF outbreaks may occur in areas where populations of ruminants and 
      potential vectors are present. In this study, we assumed the introduction of the 
      virus into Italy and focused on the risk of vector-borne transmission of RVFV to 
      three main European potential hosts (cattle, sheep and goats). Five main 
      potential mosquito vectors belonging to the Culex and Aedes genera that are 
      present in Italy were identified in a literature review. We first modelled the 
      geographical distribution of these five species based on expert knowledge and 
      using land cover as a proxy of mosquito presence. The mosquito distribution maps 
      were compared with field mosquito collections from Italy to validate the model. 
      Next, the risk of RVFV transmission was modelled using a multicriteria evaluation 
      (MCE) approach, integrating expert knowledge and the results of a literature 
      review on host sensitivity and vector competence, feeding behaviour and 
      abundance. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the 
      results with respect to expert choices. The resulting maps include (i) five maps 
      of the vector distribution, (ii) a map of suitable areas for vector-borne 
      transmission of RVFV and (iii) a map of the risk of RVFV vector-borne 
      transmission to sensitive hosts given a viral introduction. Good agreement was 
      found between the modelled presence probability and the observed presence or 
      absence of each vector species. The resulting RVF risk map highlighted strong 
      spatial heterogeneity and could be used to target surveillance. In conclusion, 
      the geographical information system (GIS)-based MCE served as a valuable 
      framework and a flexible tool for mapping the areas at risk of a pathogen that is 
      currently absent from a region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It's estimated that 40% to 60% of patients undergoing major 
      orthopedic surgery of the hip or knee who do not receive thromboprophylaxis will 
      develop deep venous thrombosis Instituto Nacional de Traumatologia e Ortopedia 
      has established a guideline to prevent DVT with the administration of the 
      Enoxaparin. Recently, institute stakeholders have been questioning this guideline 
      as new oral anticoagulants that offer more comfort and efficacy, but present 
      higher risk of bleeding, have been appearing in the market for treating deep 
      venous thrombosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to validate the application of a 
      multicriteria decision analysis in a real-world problem, the use of rivaroxaban 
      and enoxaparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis. METHODS: The multicriteria 
      method MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation 
      Technique) was used in a decision conferencing process to develop an evaluation 
      model for measuring the relative value of the drugs on each evaluation criterion, 
      separately and globally. The model-building process was informed by a literature 
      review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with a critical appraisal 
      of the evidence. RESULTS: We report a model-structure with eight criteria, each 
      one associated with a weighting coefficient and value function. Following a 
      simple additive aggregation process, the model-outputs showed that Rivaroxaban 
      was considered a robust option for DVT. Sensitivity analysis and robustness 
      analysis were performed and testify the consistency of the results. CONCLUSION: 
      This article contributes to literature by showing how MACBETH method can be 
      combined with scientific evidence and participatory group processes, for health 
      technology assessment in hospitals.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance of Lyme disease risk in Canada, 2019: Results from the 
      first year of the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN).
PG  - 354-361
LID - 10.14745/ccdr.v46i10a08 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic disease of 
      increasing public health importance in Canada. As part of its mandate, the 
      Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network (CLyDRN) launched a pan-Canadian sentinel 
      surveillance initiative, the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN), in 2019. 
      OBJECTIVES: To create a standardized, national sentinel surveillance network 
      providing a real-time portrait of the evolving environmental risk of Lyme disease 
      in each province. METHODS: A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was 
      used in the selection of sentinel regions. Within each sentinel region, a 
      systematic drag sampling protocol was performed in selected sampling sites. Ticks 
      collected during these active surveillance visits were identified to species, and 
      Ixodes spp. ticks were tested for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia 
      miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti and Powassan virus. 
      RESULTS: In 2019, a total of 567 Ixodes spp. ticks (I. scapularis [n=550]; I. 
      pacificus [n=10]; and I. angustus [n=7]) were collected in seven provinces: 
      British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
      Prince Edward Island. The highest mean tick densities (nymphs/100 m(2)) were 
      found in sentinel regions of Lunenburg (0.45), Montréal (0.43) and Granby (0.38). 
      Overall, the Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence in ticks was 25.2% (0%-45.0%). One 
      I. angustus nymph from British Columbia was positive for Babesia microti, a first 
      for the province. The deer tick lineage of Powassan virus was detected in one 
      adult I. scapularis in Nova Scotia. CONCLUSION: CaLSeN provides the first 
      coordinated national active surveillance initiative for tick-borne disease in 
      Canada. Through multidisciplinary collaborations between experts in each 
      province, the pilot year was successful in establishing a baseline for Lyme 
      disease risk across the country, allowing future trends to be detected and 
      studied.

TI  - Integrated models to support multiobjective ecological restoration decisions.
PG  - 1418-1427
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12939 [doi]
AB  - Many objectives motivate ecological restoration, including improving vegetation 
      condition, increasing the range and abundance of threatened species, and 
      improving species richness and diversity. Although models have been used to 
      examine the outcomes of ecological restoration, few researchers have attempted to 
      develop models to account for multiple, potentially competing objectives. We 
      developed a combined state-and-transition, species-distribution model to predict 
      the effects of restoration actions on vegetation condition and extent, bird 
      diversity, and the distribution of several bird species in southeastern 
      Australian woodlands. The actions reflected several management objectives. We 
      then validated the models against an independent data set and investigated how 
      the best management decision might change when objectives were valued 
      differently. We also used model results to identify effective restoration options 
      for vegetation and bird species under a constrained budget. In the examples we 
      evaluated, no one action (improving vegetation condition and extent, increasing 
      bird diversity, or increasing the probability of occurrence for threatened 
      species) provided the best outcome across all objectives. In agricultural lands, 
      the optimal management actions for promoting the occurrence of the Brown 
      Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), an iconic threatened species, resulted in 
      little improvement in the extent of the vegetation and a high probability of 
      decreased vegetation condition. This result highlights that the best management 
      action in any situation depends on how much the different objectives are valued. 
      In our example scenario, no management or weed control were most likely to be the 
      best management options to satisfy multiple restoration objectives. Our approach 
      to exploring trade-offs in management outcomes through integrated modeling and 
      structured decision-support approaches has wide application for situations in 
      which trade-offs exist between competing conservation objectives.

TI  - Italian Society of Hematology practice guidelines for the management of iron 
      overload in thalassemia major and related disorders.

LID - 10.3324/haematol.12413 [doi]
AB  - New measures of iron accumulation in liver and heart (superconducting quantum 
      inference device and magnetic resonance imaging), and oral iron chelators 
      (deferiprone and deferasirox) are available for managing iron overload in 
      thalassemia major. To assure appropriate use of these new health technologies, 
      the Italian Society of Hematology appointed a panel of experts to produce 
      clinical practice-guidelines for the management of iron overload in thalassemia 
      major and related disorders. The analytical hierarchy process, a technique for 
      multicriteria decision analysis, was applied to relevant key questions in order 
      to identify the alternative strategies, generate explicit criteria for their 
      evaluation, and check how well the alternatives fulfilled the criteria. The 
      result of a comprehensive systematic review of articles released from 1990 to 
      2007 was used as a source of scientific evidence to compare the decisional 
      options pairwise, and select the final recommendation. Every step in the model 
      was developed from questionnaires and group discussion. The resulting 
      recommendations advise about which examination to carry out in order to plan iron 
      chelation therapy, when to start iron chelation, which iron chelator to choose in 
      regularly transfused patients, how to monitor iron chelation therapy, and when 
      and how to switch standard therapy.

TI  - Integrated wildfire risk assessment: framework development and application on the 
      Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana, USA.
PG  - 329-42
LID - 10.1002/ieam.1365 [doi]
AB  - The financial, socioeconomic, and ecological impacts of wildfire continue to 
      challenge federal land management agencies in the United States. In recent years, 
      policymakers and managers have increasingly turned to the field of risk analysis 
      to better manage wildfires and to mitigate losses to highly valued resources and 
      assets (HVRAs). Assessing wildfire risk entails the interaction of multiple 
      components, including integrating wildfire simulation outputs with geospatial 
      identification of HVRAs and the characterization of fire effects to HVRAs. We 
      present an integrated and systematic risk assessment framework that entails 3 
      primary analytical components: 1) stochastic wildfire simulation and burn 
      probability modeling to characterize wildfire hazard, 2) expert-based modeling to 
      characterize fire effects, and 3) multicriteria decision analysis to characterize 
      preference structures across at-risk HVRAs. We demonstrate application of this 
      framework for a wildfire risk assessment performed on the Little Belts Assessment 
      Area within the Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana, United States. We 
      devote particular attention to our approach to eliciting and encapsulating expert 
      judgment, in which we: 1) adhered to a structured process for using expert 
      judgment in ecological risk assessment, 2) used as our expert base local resource 
      scientists and fire/fuels specialists who have a direct connection to the 
      specific landscape and HVRAs in question, and 3) introduced multivariate response 
      functions to characterize fire effects to HVRAs that consider biophysical 
      variables beyond fire behavior. We anticipate that this work will further the 
      state of wildfire risk science and will lead to additional application of risk 
      assessment to inform land management planning.

TI  - Can the EVIDEM Framework Tackle Issues Raised by Evaluating Treatments for Rare 
      Diseases: Analysis of Issues and Policies, and Context-Specific Adaptation.
PG  - 285-301
LID - 10.1007/s40273-015-0340-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The multiplicity of issues, including uncertainty and ethical 
      dilemmas, and policies involved in appraising interventions for rare diseases 
      suggests that multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) based on a holistic 
      definition of value is uniquely suited for this purpose. The objective of this 
      study was to analyze and further develop a comprehensive MCDA framework (EVIDEM) 
      to address rare disease issues and policies, while maintaining its applicability 
      across disease areas. METHODS: Specific issues and policies for rare diseases 
      were identified through literature review. Ethical and methodological foundations 
      of the EVIDEM framework v3.0 were systematically analyzed from the perspective of 
      these issues, and policies and modifications of the framework were performed 
      accordingly to ensure their integration. RESULTS: Analysis showed that the 
      framework integrates ethical dilemmas and issues inherent to appraising 
      interventions for rare diseases but required further integration of specific 
      aspects. Modification thus included the addition of subcriteria to further 
      differentiate disease severity, disease-specific treatment outcomes, and economic 
      consequences of interventions for rare diseases. Scoring scales were further 
      developed to include negative scales for all comparative criteria. A methodology 
      was established to incorporate context-specific population priorities and 
      policies, such as those for rare diseases, into the quantitative part of the 
      framework. This design allows making more explicit trade-offs between competing 
      ethical positions of fairness (prioritization of those who are worst off), the 
      goal of benefiting as many people as possible, the imperative to help, and wise 
      use of knowledge and resources. It also allows addressing variability in 
      institutional policies regarding prioritization of specific disease areas, in 
      addition to existing uncertainty analysis available from EVIDEM. CONCLUSION: The 
      adapted framework measures value in its widest sense, while being responsive to 
      rare disease issues and policies. It provides an operationalizable platform to 
      integrate values, competing ethical dilemmas, and uncertainty in appraising 
      healthcare interventions.

AB  - In the present study an overlay method to assess groundwater vulnerability is 
      proposed. This new method based on multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was 
      developed and validated using an appropriate case study in Aragon area (NE 
      Spain). The Vulnerability Index to Nitrates from Agricultural Sources (VINAS) 
      incorporates a novel Logic Scoring of Preferences (LSP) approach, and it has been 
      developed using public geographic information from the European Union. VINAS-LSP 
      identifies areas with five categories of vulnerability, taking into account the 
      hydrogeological and environmental characteristics of the territory as a whole. 
      The resulting LSP map is a regional screening tool that can provide guidance on 
      the potential risk of nitrate pollution, as well as highlight areas where 
      specific research and farming planning policies are required.

TI  - An Analytic Network Process approach for siting a municipal solid waste plant in 
      the Metropolitan Area of Valencia (Spain).
PG  - 1071-86

AB  - In this paper the Analytic Network Process (ANP) is applied to select the best 
      location for the construction of a municipal solid waste (MSW) plant in the 
      Metropolitan area of Valencia (Spain). Selection of the appropriate MSW facility 
      location can be viewed as a complex multicriteria decision-making problem that 
      requires an extensive evaluation process of the potential MSW plant locations and 
      other factors as diverse as economic, technical, legal, social or environmental 
      issues. The decision-making process includes the identification of six candidate 
      MSW plant sites and 21 criteria grouped into clusters for the construction of a 
      network. Two technicians of the Metropolitan Waste Disposal Agency acted as 
      decision makers (DMs). The influences between the elements of the network were 
      identified and analyzed using the ANP multicriteria decision method. Two 
      different ANP models were used: one hierarchy model (that considers AHP as a 
      particular case of ANP) and another network-based model. The results obtained in 
      each model were compared and analyzed. The strengths and weaknesses of ANP as a 
      multicriteria decision analysis tool are also described in the paper. The main 
      findings of this research have proved that ANP is a useful tool to help 
      technicians to make their decision process traceable and reliable. Moreover, this 
      approach helps DMs undertake a sound reflection of the siting problem.

TI  - Social life cycle assessment and participatory approaches: A methodological 
      proposal applied to citrus farming in Southern Italy.
PG  - 383-96
LID - 10.1002/ieam.1611 [doi]
AB  - Recently, Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) has been developed under the 
      methodological framework of Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) to evaluate the social 
      impacts that emerge during the overall life cycle of a product or service. There 
      is not yet a standardized methodology for S-LCA as there is for environmental LCA 
      (eLCA), due to the nature of social impacts that do not depend only on the 
      processes themselves, but also on the behavior and context of actors 
      (manufactures, consumers, local community members, etc.). One of the most 
      critical steps in the application of S-LCA concerns the choice of criteria for 
      selecting affected actors, impact categories, subcategories, and the taxonomic 
      relation among them. Moreover, the importance (in terms of weight) of these 
      impacts may be felt differently by affected actors, confirming the importance of 
      the context within which impacts arise. In this sense, the integration of 
      participatory tools can be useful in making the S-LCA more locally relevant. The 
      aim of the present study is twofold. First, we will outline a methodology that 
      combines S-LCA with two research tools. The first is the focus group, adopted 
      from qualitative research. The second is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), 
      adopted from operational research, which belongs to the framework of 
      Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). These have been used to make the S-LCA 
      more locally relevant and to legitimate the criteria used. Second, we will test 
      this methodology by applying it to a specific field, i.e., 3 production areas and 
      3 different crop systems of citrus growing in the Calabria region in Southern 
      Italy. Citrus growing is one of the most important agricultural sectors at 
      regional level, and it is also well known for issues of social concern, 
      particularly in relation to immigrant workers. The results show a number of 
      differences between cases and could offer useful insights to both local decision 
      makers, such as agricultural entrepreneurs, and to those public decision makers 
      that design and implement territorial planning strategies. Results have allowed 
      the authors to rank the social performance of each case and to reflect on the 
      most critical steps in conducting an S-LCA. KEY FINDINGS: The integration of 
      qualitative techniques and a multicriteria in sLCA allows catching local 
      specificities by involving local experts and stakeholders Results highlighted 
      that impact categories mostly contributed to performance differences Public 
      deciders can be supported in deciding which farming practices should be 
      encouraged, which social domains must be paid more attention, and where social 
      problems mostly occur The methodological application allowed the authors also to 
      foresee the feasibility of the integration of LCA and LCC results as inputs in 
      sLCA to conduct a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA).

TI  - Point of truth calibration for disease prioritisation-A case study of 
      prioritisation of exotic diseases for the pig industry in Australia.

LID - S0167-5877(17)30098-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.01.017 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to trial point of truth calibration (POTCal) as a 
      novel method for disease prioritisation. To illustrate the application of this 
      method, we used a previously described case-study of prioritisation of exotic 
      diseases for the pig industry in Australia. Disease scenarios were constructed 
      from criteria which described potential impact and pig-producers were asked to 
      score the importance of each scenario. POTCal was used to model participants' 
      estimates of disease importance as a function of the criteria, to derive a 
      predictive model to prioritise a range of exotic diseases. The best validation of 
      producers' estimates was achieved using a model derived from all responses. The 
      highest weighted criteria were attack rate, case fatality rate and market loss, 
      and the highest priority diseases were the vesicular diseases followed by swine 
      fevers and zoonotic encephalitides. Comparison of results with a previous study 
      in which probabilistic inversion was used to prioritise diseases for the same 
      group of producers highlighted differences between disease prioritisation 
      methods. Overall, this study demonstrated that POTCal can be used for disease 
      prioritisation. An advantage of POTCal is that valid models can be developed that 
      reflect decision-makers' heuristics. Specifically, this evaluation of the use of 
      POTCal in animal health illustrates how the judgements of participants can be 
      incorporated into a decision-making process. Further research is needed to 
      investigate the influence of scenarios presented to participants during POTCal 
      evaluations, and the robustness of this approach applied to different disease 
      issues (e.g. exotic versus endemic) and production types (e.g. intensive versus 
      extensive). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of POTCal for 
      disease prioritisation.

TI  - The Importance of Economic Perspective and Quantitative Approaches in Oncology 
      Value Frameworks of Drug Selection and Shared Decision Making.
PG  - S6-S12
LID - 10.18553/jmcp.2017.23.6-a.s6 [doi]
AB  - The debate around value in oncology drug selection has been prominent in recent 
      years, and several professional bodies have furthered this debate by advocating 
      for so-called value frameworks. Herein, we provide a viewpoint on these value 
      frameworks, emphasizing the need to consider 4 key aspects: (1) the economic 
      underpinnings of value; (2) the importance of the perspective adopted in the 
      valuation; (3) the importance of the difference between absolute and relative 
      measures of risk and measuring patient preferences; and (4) the recognition of 
      multiple quality-of-life (QoL) domains, and the aggregation and valuation of 
      those domains, through utilities within a multicriteria decision analysis, may 
      allow prioritization of QoL above the tallying of safety events, particularly in 
      a value framework focusing on the individual patient. While several frameworks 
      exist, they incorporate different attributes and-importantly-assess value from 
      alternative perspectives, including those of patients, regulators, payers, and 
      society. The various perspectives necessarily lead to potentially different, if 
      not sometimes divergent, conclusions about the valuation. We show that the 
      perspective of the valuation affects the framing of the risk/benefit question and 
      the methodology to measure the individual patient choice, or preference, as 
      opposed to the collective, or population, choice. We focus specifically on the 
      American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Value Framework. We argue that its 
      laudable intent to assist in shared clinician-patient decision making can be 
      augmented by more formally adopting methodology underpinned by micro- and health 
      economic concepts, as well as application of formal quantitative approaches. Our 
      recommendations for value frameworks focusing on the individual patient, such as 
      the ASCO Value Framework, are 3-fold: (1) ensure that stakeholders understand the 
      importance of the adopted (economic) perspective; (2) consider using exclusively 
      absolute measures of risk and formal patient-preference methodology; and (3) 
      consider foregoing safety parameters for higher-order utility considerations.

AB  - The term vulnerability has been more frequently used in several studies, striving 
      to better understand the specificities and needs of different population groups. 
      The scope of this study was to identify, characterize and analyze populations in 
      situations of socio-environmental vulnerability in Rio de Janeiro city, 
      consolidating social, economic, environmental, health and public security 
      indicators in a synthesis index - the Socio-Environmental Vulnerability Index. 
      The data sources used were the IBGE-2010 Demographic Census, the Geo-Rio 
      Foundation and the Public Security Institute of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The 
      methodology integrated Multicriteria Decision Analysis into a Geographic 
      Information System. According to our results, the socio-environmental 
      vulnerability in Rio de Janeiro city is aggravated by risk situations and 
      environmental degradation. Those aspects are accentuated by the population 
      density in shantytown areas, where the most disadvantaged strata exist in a 
      process of environmental and urban exclusion. The study makes it possible to 
      locate spatially vulnerable areas, emphasizing the importance of these tools to 
      guide resource allocation, formulation and implementation of more effective 
      public policies.

TI  - From optimization to adaptation: shifting paradigms in environmental management 
      and their application to remedial decisions.
PG  - 92-8
AB  - Current uncertainties in our understanding of ecosystems require shifting from 
      optimization-based management to an adaptive management paradigm. Risk managers 
      routinely make suboptimal decisions because they are forced to predict 
      environmental response to different management policies in the face of complex 
      environmental challenges, changing environmental conditions, and even changing 
      social priorities. Rather than force risk managers to make single suboptimal 
      management choices, adaptive management explicitly acknowledges the uncertainties 
      at the time of the decision, providing mechanisms to design and institute a set 
      of more flexible alternatives that can be monitored to gain information and 
      reduce the uncertainties associated with future management decisions. Although 
      adaptive management concepts were introduced more than 20 y ago, their 
      implementation has often been limited or piecemeal, especially in remedial 
      decision making. We believe that viable tools exist for using adaptive management 
      more fully. In this commentary, we propose that an adaptive management approach 
      combined with multicriteria decision analysis techniques would result in a more 
      efficient management decision-making process as well as more effective 
      environmental management strategies. A preliminary framework combining the 2 
      concepts is proposed for future testing and discussion.

AB  - Novel methodology for grouping and ranking with application of self-organizing 
      maps and multicriteria decision analysis is presented. The dataset consists of 22 
      objects that are analytical procedures applied to furan determination in food 
      samples. They are described by 10 variables, referred to their analytical 
      performance, environmental and economic aspects. Multivariate statistics analysis 
      allows to limit the amount of input data for ranking analysis. Assessment results 
      show that the most beneficial procedures are based on microextraction techniques 
      with GC-MS final determination. It is presented how the information obtained from 
      both tools complement each other. The applicability of combination of grouping 
      and ranking is also discussed.

TI  - Rapid mapping and prioritisation of wetland sites in the Manawatu-Wanganui 
      region, New Zealand.
PG  - 316-25
AB  - The extent of wetland in New Zealand has decreased by approximately 90% since 
      European settlement began in 1840. Remaining wetlands continue to be threatened 
      by drainage, weeds, and pest invasion. This article presents a rapid method for 
      broad-scale mapping and prioritising palustrine and estuarine wetlands for 
      conservation. Classes of wetland (lacustrine, estuarine, riverine, marine, and 
      palustrine) were mapped using Landsat ETM+ imagery and centre-points of 
      palustrine and estuarine sites as ancillary data. The results shown are for the 
      Manawatu-Wanganui region, which was found to have 3060 ha of palustrine and 250 
      ha of estuarine wetlands. To set conservation priorities, landscape indicators 
      were computed from a land-cover map and a digital terrain model. Four global 
      indicators were used (representativeness, area, surrounding naturalness, and 
      connectivity), and each was assigned a value to score wetland sites in the 
      region. The final score is an additive function that weights the relative 
      importance of each indicator (i.e., multicriteria decision analysis). The whole 
      process of mapping and ranking wetlands in the Manawatu-Wanganui region took only 
      6 weeks. The rapid methodology means that consistent wetland inventories and 
      ranking can now actually be produced at reasonable cost, and conservation 
      resources may therefore be better targeted. With complete inventories and 
      priority lists of wetlands, managers will be able to plan for conservation 
      without having to wait for the collection of detailed biologic information, which 
      may now also be prioritised.

TI  - Multicriteria evaluation tools to support the conceptual design of activated 
      sludge systems.
PG  - 85-94
AB  - During the past decade the pressure of the whole spectrum of stakeholders has 
      increased considerably leading the consideration of different types of 
      objectives, i.e. economical, technical, legal and environmental, into the process 
      design efforts. Thus, the traditional design approaches should turn into more 
      complex assessment methods including different types of objectives in order to 
      conduct integrated assessments. The objective of this paper is to present and 
      discuss the usefulness of three evaluation tools, based on multicriteria decision 
      analysis, to support the conceptual design of activated sludge systems These 
      support tools consist of: i) preliminary multiobjective optimization, where the 
      most promising options (those located near to the optimum) are compared based on 
      the results of dynamic simulation, ii) identification of strong and weak points 
      for each option by means of classification trees and the subsequent extraction of 
      knowledge-based rules, and iii) evaluation of the trade-offs between a certain 
      evaluation criteria and the overall process performance through the integrated 
      application of mathematical modelling and qualitative knowledge extracted during 
      the design process.

TI  - Dataset for the model of a municipality competitiveness in relation to the 
      geothermal resources exploitation in Poland.
PG  - 105687
LID - 10.1016/j.dib.2020.105687 [doi]
LID - 105687
AB  - This dataset corresponds with the manuscript "The impact of geothermal resources 
      on the competitiveness of municipalities: evidence from Poland" [1]. In the 
      paper, the geothermal resources are assumed as a local competitive advantage for 
      the municipalities that exploit them. In order to examine the relation between 
      the exploitation of the geothermal resources and local competitiveness we 
      determine a model of municipality competitiveness in Poland. Concept of the local 
      competitiveness is referred to place-based measures (Lovering [2], Mytelka and 
      Farinelli [3], Plummer and Taylor [4], Kitson et al.[5]) and it is related to the 
      management of local resources (Malecki [6], Turok [7]). Literature review 
      suggests that the local competitiveness is best reflected in the indicators of 
      economic welfare and sustainability (Meyer-Stamer [8], Audretsch et al.[9]). 
      Therefore, we use an expert method to build the model of a municipality 
      competitiveness indicators on the example of Poland. Throughout the Analytical 
      Hierarchy Process (AHP) method engaged experts select the 24 indicators of local 
      competitiveness. This method serves in situations of a problem complexity 
      (Kamenetzky [10], Saaty [11]) and as a multicriteria method in the regional 
      studies (Dinc et al. [12]). Aggregation of the AHP selected indicators yields a 
      synthetic competitiveness index for each of the municipalities that we examine. 
      This index constitutes the model dependent variable in the related research 
      article. This procedure of building municipality competitiveness model sets an 
      example of approaching a complex phenomenon such as the local competitiveness 
      definition. The versatility of this method enables its application into related 
      research cases.

TI  - Integrating legal liabilities in nanomanufacturing risk management.
PG  - 7955-62
LID - 10.1021/es3003266 [doi]
AB  - Among other things, the wide-scale development and use of nanomaterials is 
      expected to produce costly regulatory and civil liabilities for nanomanufacturers 
      due to lingering uncertainties, unanticipated effects, and potential toxicity. 
      The life-cycle environmental, health, and safety (EHS) risks of nanomaterials are 
      currently being studied, but the corresponding legal risks have not been 
      systematically addressed. With the aid of a systematic approach that holistically 
      evaluates and accounts for uncertainties about the inherent properties of 
      nanomaterials, it is possible to provide an order of magnitude estimate of 
      liability risks from regulatory and litigious sources based on current knowledge. 
      In this work, we present a conceptual framework for integrating estimated legal 
      liabilities with EHS risks across nanomaterial life-cycle stages using empirical 
      knowledge in the field, scientific and legal judgment, probabilistic risk 
      assessment, and multicriteria decision analysis. Such estimates will provide 
      investors and operators with a basis to compare different technologies and 
      practices and will also inform regulatory and legislative bodies in determining 
      standards that balance risks with technical advancement. We illustrate the 
      framework through the hypothetical case of a manufacturer of nanoscale titanium 
      dioxide and use the resulting expected legal costs to evaluate alternative 
      risk-management actions.

TI  - Establishing protective long term measures after severe nuclear accidents using 
      multiple criteria.
PG  - 676-90; appendix 690-2
AB  - This paper proposes a methodology supporting decisions on protective measures 
      following severe nuclear accidents and demonstrates its use. A multicriteria 
      decision analysis approach is adopted where value tradeoffs are postponed until 
      the very last stage of the decision process. All feasible solutions are 
      implicitly considered and evaluated in the chosen criteria. Technically inferior 
      solutions are excluded. Only the non-dominated or efficient solutions forming the 
      "efficient frontier" are retained and presented to the decision makers. 
      Implementation of inefficient solutions is in this way avoided. A choice among 
      the efficient solutions, although it implies value tradeoffs among the multiple 
      criteria, avoids the direct and apriori assessment of preferences. An interactive 
      computer package has been developed with which the decision maker can choose a 
      point on the efficient frontier in the consequence space and immediately see the 
      corresponding alternative in the decision space. The methodology is demonstrated 
      through an application on the choice among possible protective measures in 
      contaminated areas of the former USSR after the Chernobyl accident using as 
      criteria the collective effective life-time dose received by the population and 
      the cost associated with each possible decision.

      of: 1) internal homogeneity of each assessment approach, (2) similarity of 
      individual assessments between methods, and (3) effects of the use of 
      implicit/explicit assessment criteria. The actions assessed combined various 
      management approaches, including livestock management (rotation, resting), 
      vegetation management (grass seeding, brush control), and hydraulic structures 
      (dams, dykes). The outranking-facilitated assessment discriminated better between 
      actions and reduced the variability of results between individual stakeholders as 
      compared with the direct ranking of actions. In general, the two assessments 
      significantly differed in the relative preference of the five management actions 
      assessed, yet both assessments identified rotational grazing combined with 
      vegetation management (grass seeding and brush control) as the most preferred 
      management action in the study area. The comparative analysis revealed 
      inconsistencies between the use of implicit and explicit assessment criteria. Our 
      findings highlight the opportunities offered by outranking approaches to help 
      capture, structure, and make explicit stakeholder perspectives in the framework 
      of a participatory environmental assessment process, which may facilitate the 
      understanding of the multiple preferences involved. The outranking integration 
      process, which resembles a voting procedure, proved simple and transparent, with 
      potential for contributing to stakeholder engagement and trust in participatory 
      assessment.

TI  - Strategic appraisal of environmental risks: a contrast between the United 
      Kingdom's Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change and its Committee on 
      Radioactive Waste Management.
PG  - 129-42
LID - 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01484.x [doi]
AB  - In this article, we compare two high-profile strategic policy reviews undertaken 
      for the U.K. government on environmental risks: radioactive waste management and 
      climate change. These reviews took very different forms, both in terms of 
      analytic approach and deliberation strategy. The Stern Review on the Economics of 
      Climate Change was largely an exercise in expert modeling, building, within a 
      cost-benefit framework, an argument for immediate reductions in carbon emissions. 
      The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, on the other hand, followed a much 
      more explicitly deliberative and participative process, using multicriteria 
      decision analysis to bring together scientific evidence and stakeholder and 
      public values. In this article, we ask why the two reviews were different, and 
      whether the differences are justified. We conclude that the differences were 
      mainly due to political context, rather than the underpinning science, and as a 
      consequence that, while in our view "fit for purpose," they would both have been 
      stronger had they been less different. Stern's grappling with ethical issues 
      could have been strengthened by a greater degree of public and stakeholder 
      engagement, and the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management's handling of 
      issues of uncertainty could have been strengthened by the explicitly 
      probabilistic framework of Stern.
